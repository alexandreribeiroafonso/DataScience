2818,1191,2009-03-30,10952,Lam,Daniel is really cool. The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!
2818,1771,2009-04-24,12798,Alice,"Daniel is the most amazing host! His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!"
2818,1989,2009-05-03,11869,Natalja,"We had such a great time in Amsterdam. Daniel is an excellent host! Very friendly and everytime helpful. The room was cozy, comfortable, and VERY clean. Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.
Totally recommendable! "
2818,2797,2009-05-18,14064,Enrique,Very professional operation. Room is very clean and comfortable. Location is close to tram or bus which take you to most of attractions. A great and helpful host who want to ensure you enjoy your stay.  
2818,3151,2009-05-25,17977,Sherwin,Daniel is highly recommended.  He provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). His place is very clean.  It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here.
2818,4748,2009-06-29,20192,Jie,"Daniel was a great host! He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!

2818,5202,2009-07-07,23055,Vanessa,"Daniele is an amazing host! He provided everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable and easy! The rooms were clean and cozy; and he took the time to show us how to get around Amsterdam via public transportation or riding around on bicycles. You truly do feel like a local when staying with Daniele!!
"
2818,9131,2009-09-06,26343,Katja,"You can´t have a nicer start in Amsterdam. Daniel is such a great and welcoming host. The room was really light and charming, so well decorated. Daniel has a great sense of hospitality, he even helped with our luggage and gave us maps and a travelguide. He´s very open minded and helpful. We had a great time, we would stay with him again anytime we´re back in Amsterdam. Daniel made sure we had everything for a great trip, thanks again for the bikes! Hope to see you soon, Daniel!"
2818,12103,2009-10-01,40999,Marie-Eve,"Daniel was a fantastic host. His place is calm and clean, and he provided so much information on how to enjoy the amazing city of Amsterdam. Should I return to the city, his place will be my first choice! "
2818,16196,2009-11-04,38623,Graham,"Daniel was great. He couldn.t do enough for us. He has gone to a lot of trouble and added every little touch to his apartment. He can speak 5 languages so that should not be a problem for anyone.
The accomation had everything we needed and was very convienient to the bus and tram."
2818,18095,2009-11-23,48138,Klaus,"Daniel has been more then a great host: it was like having an home in Amsterdam!
If friendliness and kindness were not enough, the house was super clean and he provided all the things needed for our staying: maps, timetables, suggestions and tips, even bicycles! The location is easy to get to and from the station and the city center, 24h/24h connection, with a relaxing and serviced neighborhood. And don't worry, he speaks 5 languages if you mind having communication problems. Hope to find other guest like him in the future!"
2818,18286,2009-11-25,55661,Michael,"Daniel's apartment and room was spotless. Daniel was very friendly throughout our correspondence and was even waiting for me outside his place when I arrived (late). The apartment is very convenient to the center of the city, and an easy walk to the transportation stops. Daniel is well prepared for any guest, providing me with maps and bus schedules. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Daniel is wonderful host."
2818,24925,2010-01-27,33284,Araz,"Daniel was an exeptional host!! We only had a short stay in Amsterdam but Daniel was extremely helpful as he had all the local transport timetables mapped out and ready for us to use. His place was very clean and comfortable. Daniel was incredibly accommodating on our last day in Amsterdam. Our flight wasn't till the evening and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage for the day and return to pick them up before our flight. TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY recommend Daniel's place next time you visit Amsterdam."
2818,31154,2010-03-24,82918,Natalie,"No amount of praise for Daniel would be corny or excessive.  His place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  I felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  A friend and I stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion ""What else can I say about Daniel's place?"" and he was like, ""OH MAN!  It's one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it's quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched."""
2818,35916,2010-04-16,97200,Ludovic,"It's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.  Moreover with the hash from Island, we were stucked in amstedam and daniel help us a lot. So thanks you Daniel. If you have to come to Amsterdam, choose the Daniel's place and you will enjoy your holidays."
2818,36774,2010-04-19,103149,Faisal,"When you reach at Dainel place, be sure that all things are ready to greet you. May it be meticulously made room or spick & span bathroom or well-thought-of information on ""Things To Do"" along with relevant maps & transportation schedule to explore the city to the fullest. Nothing misses out from Daniel's radar.
His pleasing personality with great asthetic sense is just an icing on the cake.We would definately stay with him again.Thanks again for making us feel at home."
2818,39856,2010-05-03,112391,Rickey,"Daniel is a terrific host, like one of the other people stated Danile provided me with great maps and recommendations. I would stay with Daniel again anytime. "
2818,45708,2010-05-24,79479,David,Daniel was a fantastic host and we would absolutely stay again with him. Everything was as advertised and you can easily get anywhere from his apartment. 
2818,48766,2010-06-01,99878,Josh,"Our stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind European tour. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. 

The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.

I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming. 

P.S. You can check my YouTube page for videos of our stay in Amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
2818,54108,2010-06-17,131821,Amelia,"Daniel was very accomodating and friendly. It was a little pricey for what it was. The bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, I would know. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe but I did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. Overall, I was impressed but I probably would stay closer to the city center in the future."
2818,54654,2010-06-19,97097,Jenn,Daniel's place was great! We got so much relaxing in. We loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! He gave us great tips on getting around etc. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.
2818,58048,2010-06-27,147769,Andrew,"Just a short note - my first experience with AirBnB was with Daniel and it was stellar.  Exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive."
2818,62552,2010-07-08,15745,David,"Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:

1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel's doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).

2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel's apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.

3) All the ""little extras"" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb."
2818,73222,2010-08-03,164729,Michel,"Daniel is a great host. He is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.
Thank you Daniel."
2818,74084,2010-08-05,171625,Lezle,"We spent two nights at Daniel's and very much enjoyed it. Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!"
2818,87063,2010-08-30,175043,Andrew,"Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. He is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. On my next visit to Amsterdam, I would absolutely stay with Daniel again. "
2818,91025,2010-09-06,105289,Nadia,Daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in Amsterdam. He was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. He definitely comes excellently-recommended!
2818,94243,2010-09-10,202035,Agam,"Daniel's setup was very good.  Like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.  

Daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.

His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.

There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin."
2818,97728,2010-09-15,211004,Alexandra,"Our stay at Daniel was awesome. He has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. The room to rent is also very nice. It has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom. 
What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes. This was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover Amsterdam by bike. Even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. "
2818,105516,2010-09-26,217961,Sam,"my stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of of my visit to amsterdam.

"
2818,112271,2010-10-05,227259,Diana,"Daniel makes his guests feel completely welcome,  he checks in to make sure you are having a great time and if you need anything further. He is always available by phone. The room is well appointed with maps and information to get you around the Amsterdam seamlessly.  The room is nicely decorated and very clean with a armoire for your clothes so you don't need to live out of your suitcase. I would definitely stay at Daniel's again.  I had a great time."
2818,114145,2010-10-08,224147,Sylvia,"Daniel's place was without a doubt the most rewarding of our trip to Europe. His attention to details and kindness make his place an excellent alternative for those considering a bed and breakfast in Amsterdam
I strongly advise to consider his place: Great location, an affordable price, a clean and organized room and a great host. What else can you ask for?
Thanks Daniel
Hope to see u soon!"
2818,117153,2010-10-12,216750,Darlo,"My sister and I had a awesome experience in Amsterdam and it all started with Daniel, his graciousness as a host - helping us find his quiet apartment, his tea and conversations, maps, comfortable room and accommadations. We would definately stay at Daniel's the next time we visit Amsterdam. "
2818,126525,2010-10-25,241053,Roberto,"Staying st Daniel's was flawless, everything was perfect. Daniel has everything well organized and well planned for the guests. He provides maps and books of Amsterdam, and he is always available for any help you might need.

The room is very quiet, and well decorated, very clean.
He provides the room with towels, tea, coffee and a wardrobe.

I felt very comfortable, I would stay again. "
2818,140762,2010-11-17,268213,Rahul,"Daniel's place was very nice and the neighbourhood was good as well. Everything very close and reachable. If you are travelling outside amsterdam for business the station and public transport is very convinient.

Daniel is a great host. Always recomendable.

Regards
Rahul"
2818,143537,2010-11-23,54482,Marta,"Me and my boyfriend have spent three nights at Daniel´s place, and we are very pleased with the choice. Daniel is charming, always aware that everything was fine. His house is very nice, very clean and beautiful. The room is very nice and the beds are very comfortable. We had at our disposal free bikes, coffee ant tea, guides, towels, hair dryer...
The only downside is that we couldn´t be much with Daniel, who was a lovely person!
If we go back to Amsterdam we would repeat for sure!
Thank you Daniel!"
2818,161816,2011-01-01,329040,Leigh And Stefanie,Daniel provides 5 star service. He is a super nice guy and he is super friendly and well organized. I was traveling with a buddy and everything worked out great. My stay was over a year ago and I only just figured out how to write a review. Happy travels everyone !
2818,194298,2011-03-07,374779,Drew,"Daniel's place is a fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam if you expect to be spending (as you should) most or all of your time out and about in the city. It's particularly well-suited to the solo traveller and Daniel is a fantastic host. 

Slightly outside the 'core' of Amsterdam, but transport is extremely convenient and Daniel is hugely accommodating with late-night schedules. 

Only thing I'd say is that it is best if you have experienced what European apartments are actually like. Daniel's is really, really nice - but it IS European. If you're fresh off the plane from North America and have never been to Europe before I'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. But I'd say that about any European apartment. 

Hugely enjoyed my time. Highly recommend.  "
2818,196836,2011-03-11,422476,Colin,"Staying at Daniel's apartment was great! My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights and were very happy to do so. Daniel was a terrific host who made us feel at home. The room we stayed in was lovely and comfortable, and he provided us with a hair dryer, towels, tea and coffee, maps and guide books. He was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. The location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend staying here! "
2818,214718,2011-04-01,442422,Angela,"Daniel's apartment was perfect for my 5 days in Amsterdam (march 2011) and was a great value. It is only 5 minutes away from the bus and is in a safe residential area. The area has public transports, restaurants, laundry, supermarket. The apartment was also very comfortable and very well-equipped. The kitchen, work desk, shower and bathroom were all very nice. It is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. There were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. He has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. Daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. His manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.  In short: go to Amsterdam, rent Daniel's appartment and be happy. Thanks again, Daniel for a great stay! Angela (Brazil)."
2818,232163,2011-04-19,485490,Aisling,"Great Trip, accomodation was very clean and Daniel was very welcoming and professional. He provides hotel-like accomodation with a real feeling of Amsterdam. Would highly recommend a stay at Daniel's. "
2818,260298,2011-05-12,229991,Marsha,"Daniel is an amazing host!  The room is exceptionally comfortable, very good mattresses, very pretty, light and airy.  There is a tea service area with a small fridge that was very convenient.  The environment was exceptionally clean, organized and Daniel has maps and a wealth of information available for tourists.  He was great at helping us to make arrangements for tourist tickets online.  The most wonderful thing about his location is the neighborhood, especially if you are looking for a local experience.  It was very easy to use the public transit system from his location.  Everything is close.  Daniel offered bikes to use and that was fabulous.  Daniel did everything possible to provide a pleasant experience and we had an amazing time.  I highly recommend Daniel's place.  "
2818,314616,2011-06-14,636413,Sabine,We spent  a few day by Daniel. We have a very good accomotion. Daniel is very kind and busy man for his guest. We will come back to Amsterdam and defently go to Daniel. 
2818,330647,2011-06-23,668411,Marcia,"Daniel is a welcoming and accommodating host who is interesting to talk with. The room is attractive and very comfortable. The location is not far by public transport from anything that you might want to do in Amsterdam. Don't hesitate to ask Daniel questions about things to do, how to get there, and especially places to eat. His recommendations are excellent!

We loved our stay in Amsterdam and would gladly stay with Daniel again."
2818,341388,2011-06-28,711463,Sunny,"Daniel is a very kind, helpful, and nice host. We were amazed at his careful attention at every detail for the guests. Everything was very clean as a nice hotel. The room is so cozy and bright, you can even see a nice little garden from the window. 

We did not plan much for this trip, but on the first night we could perfectly plan out everything with the resources Daniel provided us. All the travel guides and efficient maps are in the room! 

If you a big fan of Thai food, ask Daniel where to go for your first meal in Amsterdam near his place- it was THE BEST. 

Thank you Daniel!!!
Sunny K"
2818,359800,2011-07-08,400176,Sharon,"Daniel is a phenomenal host; he has everything you could need and has an answer for every question we had.  The room is better than the photo and the accomodations were wonderful.  Daniel was great with communication both before and during our stay.  The location has easy access to tram, bus, stores, restaurants, and pubs - all within walking distance. I will definitely stay with Daniel again and I have already recommended his room to family and friends."
2818,369637,2011-07-12,772352,David,"Daniel is an outstanding host. He is extraordinarily organized & tidy. The room was spotless, and the two beds were comfortable. There is quite a lot of space, and a beautiful view of his backyard garden out the bedroom window. It is so nice to open the windows and see greenery and hear the chirping birds. It is an easy 10-15 minute bike ride to Amsterdam Centraal Station, and all the rest that the city has to offer. Highly recommended! I would definitely stay again."
2818,510827,2011-09-07,909454,Yana,"Daniels's place is really fantastic and he was a great host! 

His place is beautifully decorated and very clean and no detail is lost to the make the stay very comfortable for his guests. From the latest cover of ""time out amsterdam"" to color coded towel rack for guests, to the most comfortable beds and pillows, latest travel books,  keys for each guest, his place set a high standard of what Airbnb should be like.

Especially grateful for countless hours Daniel put into helping my travel parner with her lost passport/wallet in another country, and having a converter for my mac.

His home was quiet and peaceful, and he has a lovely garden. The bus is a block away, supermarket 2 blocks away, and a great restaurant Bahnus(?) is 2-3 blocks away, serves very good dinner.

Highly recommend his home for exploring Amsterdam. There is a park  about 20 minutes away that's a must see for a flower lover, it's called Oosterpark and it was delightful!"
2818,515199,2011-09-09,801728,Dominic,"Our stay with Daniel was enjoyable - our only complaint was the non-stop-rain during our visit, and really Daniel could have done nothing about this!"
2818,542894,2011-09-18,1033494,Franziska,"Daniel is a great host, he is very helpful and he can give you any info about amsterdam you need. The room as well as the bathroom and toilet are very clean. Daniel's place is located 1,4 km away from a park+ride, in a nice neighborhood and is really good connected to the city center.  Highly recommended!"
2818,554817,2011-09-21,1119102,Adam,"Daniel was the definition of a fantastic host. His place was impeccable. When we arrived (which was late, and our ETA was changed a few times due to travel woes), our beds were made, clean towels neatly wrapped, soothing music playing, and the smell of fresh eucalyptus/mint filled the air. Overall, a fantastic experience I would recommend to everyone. 

Thanks Daniel!
Adam&Jess"
2818,698543,2011-11-07,62868,Rachel,"Daniel was an absolute dream host. His place is so clean, he is EXTREMELY organized and super sweet. We had such a great time in Amsterdam and Daniel had a major part of that. I can't tell you how much I recommend staying with him! THANKS DANIEL!!!!!!"
2818,825414,2012-01-02,1475799,Dhaval,Daniel is a great host even before reaching AMS he gave us good directions on how to get to his place. Leaving @ Daniels was wonderful. He has a great place in a quiet neighboorhood with easy access to trams and busses to get to the centraal station in 15 mins. On our arrival he shared a lot of good information about places to visit. We had an extra guest at the last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate  him in the living room. AMS is awesome and would definitely like to visit back and would stay @Daniels again :)
2818,1084419,2012-04-04,1315953,Miriam,"We felt very much welcomed at Daniel's place. Very thing is well organized, you are provided with eveything you need, the room is pleasant and Daniel is a sensitive and sensible host. It felt a bit like home :-) "
2818,1194128,2012-04-28,2133939,Christina,"Daniel was a great host! This was our first time staying in a B&B and let's just say he set the bar really high. His home was extremely clean and very well organized. The garden view was so peaceful. Both my bf and myself were sick during our Europe trip and Daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. He was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. The room came equipped with coffee and tea and WiFi. His home is very close to public transportation and getting to central Amsterdam was a breeze. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I would definitely be staying at his place again. "
2818,1437274,2012-06-08,1899497,Fareeha,"I have nothing but praise for this gem of a place. Daniel is an exceptional host- he helped us carry our luggage, poured us juice, and gave us so many useful information that made our stay in Amsterdam truly memorable. The room provided a 5* experience and has everything you would possibly need for your stay. The apartment is tastefully decorated with beautiful artwork that is truly inspiring. If you are in Amsterdam, this is the place you should stay. You won't regret it. :)"
2818,1475433,2012-06-13,963429,Stefanie,"Daniel's is fantastic! 
Great location. Quiet room. Good beds. Fantastic bathroom. Spotlessly clean. Nice host. Fun bikes!
He has thought of everything to make his guests comfortable. We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam very much thanks to Daniel!
Definitely recommend and would love to go back."
2818,1540158,2012-06-23,2059915,New,"Fun guy, easy to get along with. Good location to see the sights of Barcelona which are many. Enjoyed the dialogue and chatting. Recommended as a great host. "
2818,1594647,2012-06-30,2481566,Amilcar,"I stayed with my partner at Daniel's place for almost a week and we see Daniel as the perfect host. From the first moment he welcomed us in a very kindly, respectful and positive way. He provided us information about many places to go and he was always showing us the best alternatives in Amsterdam. At his home everything is perfectly organized and clean, the room is nice, cozy, comfortably, quiet and is located in a nice neighboorhood and very well connected. Definitively Daniel has done everything as possible to make our stay more enjoyable. The place is perfect and highly recommended."
2818,1872771,2012-08-02,3018525,Luis,"I was most satisfied with my stay in Daniel's place.  It was cozy, clean, and quiet.  Daniel was very helpful in giving directions on how to best get to his place with a bit of luggage.  On getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what I wanted in the time I had.  He provided privacy though I knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  I would recommend his place to my friends.  His place is in a very convenient and safe area.  I would definitely look into his place if I had another chance to go to Amsterdam. Thanks, Daniel."
2818,2281683,2012-09-14,193685,James & Diane,"Wonderful, quiet and relaxing is the best way to describe Daniels apartment. Plus, Daniel was very accommodating and extremely helpful with directions. I would recommend Daniels apartment to anyone that is looking for a relaxing environment while visiting Amsterdam. "
2818,3657240,2013-02-28,5253122,Sidney,The reservation was canceled 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2818,3956289,2013-03-30,5640272,Rustie,"We were very well received and his place was very clean. He's kind and wants you to feel at home. Our only complaint was that we were not made aware of the early morning check out time upon arrival and came home the night before to a note on the door asking us to be out by a certain time. As long as you get all the information and communication from him, you should be fine.

"
2818,4344658,2013-04-29,5787671,Karoline,"My friend and I really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam - Daniel is so friendly  and hospitable - the greatest example of this was when we were returning to the central station, he rode his bike to give me my tiny earrings which were the only thing I forgot. He also made sure we had coffee and tea in the morning. "
2818,4524630,2013-05-10,6167602,Alexandra,"To describe our stay at Daniel's place in two words: absolutely wonderfull. Not only is Daniel a kind and caring person, but also a very attentive host who kept everything spotless. Although the apartment is close to the city center, we were more than thankfull that he lend us some bike for a real Amsterdam experience. But most of all, we really felt at home. Thank You, Daniel :)"
2818,4569852,2013-05-13,5703225,Shelley,"Daniel was absolutely fantastic! Communication was great and he gave us tons of good Amsterdam tips. He was very accessible, but let us have our space.

The apartment itself is incredibly clean, the room is a good size and very easy access to city center, rijksmuseum, vondelpark, and the train station - a 10 minute bus ride. Great wifi, tea and coffee in the room, this was a home away from home and a great first stop on our journey. This is a wonderful stay for 2 people, and I would definitely stay here again!"
2818,4928557,2013-06-02,1700889,John,"Just spent only three nights staying at Daniel's....wish it could have been a lot more.
If you want to stay at a place that is impeccably clean, organized, and with a great host then Daniel's is the place.  Daniel will do everything to make your stay enjoyable. "
2818,5120220,2013-06-13,758617,Deepak,"Of all the Airbnb places I've stayed at, Daniel has been the most professional host I've come across. Every bit of required information was provided before arrival, and the apartment was very clean and organized. The room looks just like it does in the pictures - well lit and colorful. Only slight problem we faced was a space issue when opening up multiple suitcases in the same room, but we got used to it soon enough. The room also has a mini-refrigerator - which was of great convenience. The neighborhood this apartment is located in is also very nice. Overall, very comfortable stay!"
2818,5282066,2013-06-22,6790170,Billy,"Daniel was a very kind and gracious host. Zeeberg is an interesting area that is a little rundown compared to other parts of Amsterdam but they're obviously working to improve it. Traveling to and from centraal was quick and easy, especially with Daniel's guidance on the transit system. Additionally, how Daniel handled wifi access and the keypads for the apartment was flawless and inventive. "
2818,6798865,2013-08-25,8239676,Frédéric,"Daniel est très hospitalier. Il est amical et fait en sorte que vous passiez un bon séjour chez lui et vous conseille sur la ville.
Son appartement est très propre, très bien rangé.
L'appartement est très bien desservi par les transports.
Mon ami et moi-même avons été très satisfaits de notre séjour passé dans son appartement.
Daniel is very hospitable. He is friendly and makes sure you have a good stay at home and advise you on the town.
His apartment is very clean, very tidy.
The apartment is very well served by public transport.
My friend and I were very satisfied with our stay in his apartment."

Thank´s for your service.
2818,9600146,2014-01-03,10075270,Raphaël,"Super séjour à Amsterdam et ce en partie grâce à notre hébergement de qualité. Daniel est vraiment très aimable, prend soin que vous ayez tout a votre disposition (par exemple nous avons eu la chance d'avoir des vélos de prêts pour les 5 jours sur place ce qui nous a beaucoup simplifié les trajets). La chambre en soi est très mignone, avec, encore une fois, tout ce dont vous pourriez avoir besoin à votre disposition. L'endroit est calme, plaisant, et extrêmement bien tenu! Je recommande à tous ceux qui souhaitent visiter Amsterdam en paix (ou y faire la fête) ce super logement!"
2818,11310196,2014-03-29,6029464,Alejandro,"Daniel is a a very organized and professional host. A lot of information is at the hands of the guest from the very start. Tons of leaflets, magazines and print-outs about things to do in Amsterdam (plus bus routes and timetables) can be found in the room and in the hall of the apartment. The house is extremely clean. There are bus and tram stops nearby, which make it easy to get around the city. I would not hesitate to recommend Daniel to other people that want to stay in Amsterdam."
2818,11753031,2014-04-14,10641872,Farhan,"Daniel is a great host, his place is immaculate and comfortable. Daniel provided my friend and I with all the information we needed and then some. I would recommend Daniel's place to friends and family, no complaints what so ever."
2818,12789427,2014-05-11,12496735,Maneepan,"Daniel is the good host! He provided all necessary information of the trip for us.
His place is so peaceful and cleanses. It is near to tramp and bus station just 2-3 minutes by walk. We feel safe and comfort at Daniel place. "
2818,12934868,2014-05-14,4629258,Sarah,"Daniel was very professional, welcoming and friendly. His apartment is lovely, relaxing and calming. It was impeccable and the beds were so comfortable. I loved staying here. If you go to amsterdam, I highly recommend staying with Daniel. He provided maps and information and thought of everything possible to make my stay in pleasant.  The apartment is situated near to a tram stop so it was easy to get to and from the city center. 
"
2818,13041264,2014-05-18,14368839,Alexa,"Sehr saubere und gepflegte Wohnung. Daniel war sehr hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Die Verkehrsanbindung ist super. Man ist in ca. 10 min. am Hauptbahnhof. Ich würde jederzeit wieder bei Daniels übernachten, wenn ich in Amsterdam bin."
2818,14452516,2014-06-19,14891811,Veruzka,"He was a very nice host.  Myself and my fiancee stayed for 3 days in Amsterdam and we had a great time staying with Daniel.  He gave us help of where to go in the city, he rented bikes to us, and he gave us a map that was extremely useful in getting around.  He is very well organized and the whole stay was great and very easy."
2818,14614776,2014-06-23,13154289,Joseph,"We had a amazing stay at Daniel's.  The living space, room, and bathroom facilities are kept immaculate.  The neighborhood is very peaceful, quiet, and extremely well-connected to central Amsterdam, though several eateries and cafes are within a 5-minute walk.   There is also a well-maintained park (Flevopark) at the end of the street servicing nature-lovers and runners.  Last but not least, Daniel is both available, accommodating, and kind.  Do not think twice about this place!!!"
2818,15194300,2014-07-04,17103969,Tabea,Daniel is a very friendly and helpful person. He makes our stay in Amsterdam perfect! I just can advise him. 
2818,15331290,2014-07-07,16246003,Valerio,"Tutto perfetto...

Grazie mille"
2818,15577744,2014-07-12,15548753,Tatiana,"We stayed at Daniel's for 5 nights. His apartment is very quiet and impeccably clean; the bedroom is very nice, exaclty as in the photos (pillows and duvet are very good). Besides, there is a table and a small fridge. The shower (separate from the WC)  is also very good. The apartment is not in the center but you can easily reach it by bus, tram or metro. There are various restaurants, bars and cafés in the area - this is great because you get to know places where tourists usually do not go. 
Daniel is a great host, he provided us with very useful info about transport and things to do in Ams. Our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment. I am sure Daniel would provide any further assistance that we may have needed, he really thinks about every tiny thing a tourist may need during his/her stay in Amsterdam. I also wanted to thank him for finding the contact lenses we forgot in the bedroom! Definitely recommend! "
2818,15958467,2014-07-19,15927333,Daniel,Un séjour remarquable !  Daniel est un hôte soucieux du bien- être des gens qu'ils accueillent.  Toujours disponible et fier de partager ses connaissances de sa ville pour faciliter notre séjour.  Un environnement fort jolie et très propre et un décor soigné quoi demander de mieux !
2818,16263344,2014-07-24,17449732,Felix,"We had great time during the stay at Daniel’s home.
We felt like we are home for 4 nights. He was very kind and helpful.
The room was very clean and quite. And there was a garden out of window in the room. In the every morning, when we woke up, we could see the bird’s tweet with the breeze softly. How can the morning be better?
In the night, the curtains block the light completely during sleeping.
Only alarm could interrupt our sleeping.

The bathroom was also VERY clean. The toiletries were all good stuff.
It was filled with the AROMA. Also, It was good to take a shower with good temperature and water pressure.

First of all, His house is always neat and clean. And he knew everything for the trip in Amsterdam. Also, we had a pleasant conversation with him.
Thank you, Daniel."
2818,16408539,2014-07-27,11877341,Kammy,I had a good stay at daniels place which was very clean and functional. It was also very well decorated and Daniel is very friendly and helpful!
2818,16984035,2014-08-05,16393098,Shauna,"Daniel was an excellent host! He greeted my friend and I with open arms, and was a superb resource for us. The personal maps he gave us were so handy! He went above and beyond our expectations when he was able to arrange his schedule to accept my friend's late baggage while we were enjoying the city.  I would recommend Daniel's place to everyone ! It is so close to the city center and the place is incredibly clean and comfortable! I wish we were there longer and I hope to return some day! "
2818,18056471,2014-08-21,16420968,Tina,"Not sure what else can be said about Daniel.  He is a true gentleman and was always ready with any answers (or bandaids) we needed!  His attention to detail made us feel like we were at a 5 star hotel.  The neighborhood has restaurants, bars, markets and even an awesome looking playground!   If we ever make it back to Amsterdam I won't even bother looking for somewhere else to stay!"
2818,19039663,2014-09-05,19858271,Daniel,"My experience in amsterdam was brilliant. From daniels appartment i had close access to buses and/or trams, so getting to the city centre was easy. A simple 5 minute journey.  Daniel as a host was superb, very relaxed atmosphere in his home, and he provided us with lots of information including places to go/see. I recommend daniel as a host full heartedly.  Brilliant time. Til next time!"
2818,20096728,2014-09-23,8700764,Amelia,"Daniel was a very helpful host. Upon arrival he was there to welcome us with cold drinks. He provided us with clear directions and maps of Amsterdam. He made it so easy to explore Amsterdam using public transport. He was always available and happy to answer question. He was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. He was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. The bed were very comfortable. I bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), Daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. We had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) Daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. I would recommend staying with Daniel."
2818,20302184,2014-09-27,10676984,James,"After we arrived Daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. We proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. 

The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. 

The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  

To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. If you wish to visit Amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay."
2818,20503978,2014-09-30,19381082,Anna,"Daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. His appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. 


After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.

When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. 

Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. 

We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. 
He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. 

You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! 
For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.

After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.
There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. 
The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. 
WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for (Hidden by Airbnb) , but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. 

After this he showed us the bathroom. I was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. The bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. The toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.


We can highly recommend @Daniel's and if we'll be visting Amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.


Hartstikke bedankt Daniel!"
2818,20832438,2014-10-06,20565927,Andi,"Staying at Daniel's place was as enjoyable as one could imagine. He welcomed us very kindly, showed us around and offered cold drinks. Then he already provided us with useful pieces of information.
The room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need. The beds are very comfortable und it's a rather quiet neighbourhood. He provided towels and linen and the whole flat was very tidy.
His daily weather forecast was not only useful but more so very accurate.
I would stay at his place again anytime. Highly recommended."
2818,21059309,2014-10-10,12213592,Susanne,"Daniel ist sehr zuvorkommend und denkt an alles! Er macht es dir leicht, dich willkommen zu fühlen und hilft wo er kann, um den Aufenthalt in Amsterdam zu genießen. Ich habe gut geschlafen, es war sehr sauber und ordentlich und ich habe einfach nichts, aber auch gar nichts zu beanstanden. Wenn Daniel gekonnt hätte, hätte er bestimmt auch gerne für besseres Wetter gesorgt! Ein total netter Gastgeber! Ich komme gerne wieder..."
2818,21292853,2014-10-14,20989264,Jonathan,Daniel was a great host. He gave us very detailed directions to his place and upon our arrival he provided us with maps and places to visit in amsterdam. The room was very neat and tidy. We were also provided with clean towels. Daniel's place also has easy public transport to get around. Daniel was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Highly recommended.
2818,21480086,2014-10-18,6488881,Aashay,"Daniel's place is amazing and he does an incredible job with hospitality. Everything was incredibly clean and he pretty much thought of everything (it was like staying in a little hotel inside his apartment). He was also very responsive when it came to any issues (had some issues with the wifi the first day and he took care of it right away). If you're looking for a great place to stay away from all the tourist rabble, I highly suggest Daniel's place. "
2818,21664685,2014-10-21,13195901,Doruk,Daniel was a great host. He had prepared anything we might need during our stay. He was also very professional and his phone was always open in case we needed to contact him. The flat was very clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2818,21787755,2014-10-24,21388205,Tuan,Daniel is nice. It was fun. 
2818,22033157,2014-10-28,4592146,AmBer,"Daniel was an incredible host. The room looked exactly how it does in the picture. He was incredibly helpful, and supplied any and everything we needed. 
His neighborhood is lovely and close to bus routes that go directly to the towns center. I would stay here each time  I revisit Amsterdam, and I'd recommend anyone I know to do the same. "
2818,23174233,2014-11-24,533940,Victor,"A really great Airbnb experience with Daniel. He was very friendly and helpful. The room is very nice and clean. Got everything we need. 

This was a just short trip to catch up with my friend from overseas and both of us didn't spend too much time to plan the trip beforehand. But with Daniel's advice we did manage to have some great time in Amsterdam. "
2818,24206321,2014-12-22,13546702,Florian,Daniel was a wonderful host and the room was just as described/pictured.  He was able to provide good recommendations for what to do and had available things that travels need but tend to forget.  We rented bikes (for a small additional daily fee) -- that were in great condition and included everything we needed to be able to lock them up and ride safely at night -- and we found them to be a great way to get to know Amsterdam quickly and efficiently.  The neighborhood is very nice and it's easy to get to the heart of Amsterdam by bus or bike.  Highly recommended.
2818,24688179,2015-01-01,7992090,Alma,"I had a really wonderful stay at Daniel's. Daniel went above and beyond what I would expect from a host. The place is impeccable, comfortable and a really great to stay for a few days in Amsterdam! I absolutely recommend staying with him."
2818,25046545,2015-01-05,24755577,Laia,"Esta ha sido nuestra primera experiencia con Airbnb y la verdad, no hemos podido hacer mejor elección. Daniel es un encanto de persona hemos estado muy cómodas, cuida el mínimo detalle para hacerte sentir 100% como en casa. Aparte de ser una persona encantadora es muy servicial y en todo momento nos facilitó todo tipo de información necesaria para nuestro viaje sea del tipo que sea. Es muy atento y le puedes pedir cualquier cosa, la verdad es que cuida mucho a sus huéspedes y hace que te lleves un gran recuerdo de su casa y de la ciudad, que, por cierto, ánimo a todo el mundo a visitarla.
Por otro lado, comentar también que las fotos de la habitación son tal cual,es decir, no te llevas ningún tipo de desengaño tema foto vs realidad.
Desde aquí aprovecho para mandarle un saludo a Daniel.
Muchísimas gracias por todo.
Laia"
2818,25881134,2015-01-28,25399998,Taylor,"Daniel's home was beautiful!  It is just as pictured!  His home was very clean and neat!  As soon as we arrived, Daniel showed us around his home and we had a cup of tea.  He told us everything we needed to know and let us ask him any questions we had!! His home is very organized and was color-coordinated as far as towels and bathroom items!  He had bikes for us to rent (13 euro first day, 7 euro each day after) and they were great!! We got to see the city as the locals do and biking was so much fun!! It's difficult to get used to if you don't bike everyday, but it was so much fun! And Daniel told us everything we needed to know about biking in he city! Daniel's home is a 10 minute bike ride into the city which is perfect for any tourist wanting to see the city and an average Dutch neighborhood!  Our stay was short, 3 nights, but Daniel made us feel at home and we loved our cozy beds to crawl into at night! I would definitely stay here again! Daniel and his home were perfect! "

2818,26748548,2015-02-18,25733503,Emilie,"We had a great stay at Daniel's.

The room is exactly as described. Everything was spot clean, we were provided with several bath towels, plenty of storage room, and multiple guidebooks and maps of the city.

Daniel was a great host, very eager to help and always available a text message away when he wasn't home. 

Definitely recommend staying at his place. The location is great too with the city centre only a short bus trip or cycle ride away !"
2818,27163384,2015-02-27,3321930,Jörg,Daniels Unterkunft ist ein perfekter Ort um in Amsterdam zu übernachten. Die Anbindung mit Bus und Bahn ist perfekt. Man kann auch zu Fuß die Innenstadt gut erreichen und auf dem Weg gibt es einiges zu entdecken. Die Betten sind gemütlich und die Wohnung geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Daniel hatte gute Tipps für uns und ist ein sehr angenehmer Zeitgenosse. Mein persönlicher Tipp ist das Thai Restaurant in der Javastraat um die Ecke. Nächstes mal in Amsterdam bin ich gerne wieder Gast dort. Thank's for the time at your place. See you next time. Peace. 
2818,28343101,2015-03-22,17837628,Sophie,"We had a lovely stay in Daniel's home. He made us feel very welcome and was very happy to help, giving us ideas of places to visit or answering any questions we had. He gave us a map which helped us easily find public transport into the city centre.

2818,28540642,2015-03-25,28712303,Sheldon,My stay at Daniel was good. He did a great job of staying in contact with through all my traveling delays. Daniel's place is a about a 12 minute bus ride away from Central Amsterdam. The place is very clean and quiet. The only thing missing would be television in the room. If you are looking to enjoy and explore Amsterdam this is a good place. 
2818,29497034,2015-04-08,25907928,Nadia,"This was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience.  I cannot recommend Daniel enough, he was so accommodating, he went out of his way to get the answers to our questions, it was very convenient that he had his own bikes for us to rent. He messaged me all the time to make sure I was ok and would also give a prompt reply if I asked him a question. The place was very clean and looks exactly the same as the pictures.  I highly recommend daniel and would defiantly stay here on my next trip to amsterdam.   Thank you for a pleasant stay daniel."

2818,31590351,2015-05-07,28987927,Ti,"Staying at Daniel's was great. He welcomed us with a beer, gave us all the info we needed, his apartment was spotless clean and most important, he has two bikes that you can rent. And when in Amsterdam having a bike is a must have. We had a great time in Amsterdam and at Daniel's.

2818,32967920,2015-05-24,19020174,Stephen,"Daniel was incredibly welcoming and ensured that all and any concerns I had were met immediately with rectification. I would say generally, he went above and beyond the call of duty.

The apartment was well situated in terms of public transport links and is walking distance (with good shoes) from the city.

Would definitely recommend staying at Daniel's"
2818,33353330,2015-05-27,10515603,Eleanor,"We had a wonderful experience @ Daniel's. Daniel was the perfect host - friendly, attentive and always available. He provided us with a much appreciated glass of water on arrival after taking our bags, and gave us a debrief on accessing the city via public transport. He provided us with maps to use for the buses as well as for the bikes (if you have the chance to utilise the bikes available for hire, definitely do so! You won't regret it!). The public transport is very easy to use - roughly a 5 minute walk to the bus stop and a 12 minute bus ride into the city. We had no trouble getting anywhere. Daniel was sure to check in with us over the few days that we stayed to see if we were okay and if we needed anything. The room was well serviced. He looked after us so well. Thank you Daniel!"
2818,33581423,2015-05-30,30524482,Karlheinz,Nice and quite room located in a gentrified area of Amsterdam apart from the touristic hot spots. I really enjoyed my stay not at least due to the charming host.
2818,33984656,2015-06-03,28738000,Elena,"L'appartamento è molto pulito. Daniel è molto accogliente, attento ad ogni esigenza dei suoi ospiti. Ci ha dato cartine e indicazioni utili al nostro soggiono. Molto comodo il noleggio delle biciclette direttamente da lui: il centro è raggiungibile in 10,15 minuti. Daniel è sempre reperibile al telefono per qualsiasi informazione e, quando è in casa, sempre disponibile per due chiacchiere e una birra...
The room is very cosy, with everything you need, and the area of the flat is  quiet and within easy reach from the city center. Renting the bikes from Daniel is great because  you can start using them as soon as you arrive. Daniel is discreet but welcoming, and you can rely on him if you need any updated information regarding what's going on in Amsterdam. Great stay, indeed. 
"
2818,34529146,2015-06-09,30289149,Bernhard,"Our stay at Daniel's was really, really comfortable and very friendly - as often mentioned: the perfect host! Good information in advance made it a breeze to find the location. We had warmly welcome with a can of beer and Daniel provided us with lots of useful information (ideas, maps, tipps, how to use public transport, P&R, ...) about Amsterdam and made it easy for us to get a good start for our city trip.  He also was always at hand, when we needed some help. The rooms are very clean, you got everything you need for a good stay, and you even can borrow two bikes from Daniel. Like this, we could experience the city like we were living there - by bike. If we were going there once again, we know where to stay ;)"
2818,35099940,2015-06-15,6164576,Ben,Daniel is a great host. The apt is clean and in a nice neighborhood. I was able to run in a very nice park a couple of blocks away. You cannot walk down to the tourist part of town from his area but there is a bus close by that will get you there. I recommend Daniels Airbnb.
2818,35452857,2015-06-19,29294505,Jan,"Daniel was the perfect host. Great instructions on how to get there, and he met me at the door with a big smile. Accommodation was immaculately clean, and Daniel was attentive to any needs I may have had.  His attention to detail is quite remarkable. Along with that, and his thorough knowledge of the area, it was a very enjoyable stay.  Thanks Daniel."

2818,38493072,2015-07-16,32161750,Lorena And Felipe,"Daniel è una persona estremamente gentile. L'accoglienza è stata molto buona. Ci ha fornito mappe della città, indicazioni ed è estremamente disponibile in caso di qualsiasi necessità. La stanza era in perfetto ordine, pulita e profumata e non ci è mancato niente. Che dire Amsterdam è una bellissima città e per quanto riguarda la nostra esperienza anche le persone sono molto gentili! 
Il quartiere è carino, servito da mezzi che in pochi minuti ti portano nel centro. Infine un'ottima esperienza!!!"
2818,40093760,2015-07-28,11275359,AnnMarie,Daniel is a fantastic host and so are his cozy quarters. He welcomes you with a beverage and maps with detailed information to make your stay a pleasant one. His home is clean and very well equipped. He makes every effort to keep in touch with you when a question my arise. The nieghborhood is not in the centeral part of Amsterdam but public transport is no problem. The nieghborhood is quiet and has nice cafes in the surrounding area. Loved my time there. 
2818,40592719,2015-08-01,17293453,Dennis,Daniel was a great host. He welcomed us into his home and gave us a plethora of information about the town and how to get around. He was very available for questions and incredibly nice. We were looking for a relaxing stay so we mostly kept to ourselves and he seemed to respect that as well but I got the idea that he would have been very sociable if that is the kind of stay you are interested in.
2818,42521115,2015-08-14,33350700,Laetitia,"L'accueil est très chaleureux et agréable. Daniel est gentil et aux petits soins. La chambre est très propre et bien décorée. On se sent bien chez lui. On se sent en sécurité dans le quartier, tout a été parfait ! Je le recommande.

Il nous a donner plusieurs idées et moyens pratiques pour nous déplacer, nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce logement, quartier bien situé, ni trop près ni trop loin du centre d'Amsterdam ! Et accès rapide à vélos, loués directement chez l'hôte, une très bonne expérience! Nous le remercions pour ce séjour !"

Daniel ist sehr angenehm, ein sehr netter Gastgeber. Er hat uns viele Tipps gegeben, war immer sehr hilfsbereit. Wenn er nicht persönlich für Fragen da war konnten wir ihn mobil erreichen - er meldete sich immer umgehend.
Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet, alles picobello sauber.
Die Anbindung mit dem Bus bzw. mit der Straßenbahn ist super.
Falls wir nochmals nach Amsterdam fahren, dann wieder zu Daniel!"
2818,45471019,2015-09-03,2537590,Stuart,Although I came late he took time from work to meet and to brief me. Competent and clean. 
2818,46271841,2015-09-09,25665174,Ron,"Daniel is the perfect host - warm, welcoming, and helpful. The moment I stepped into his flat, he sat me down, offered me a drink, and then went over Amsterdam's public transit system and potential sightseeing suggestions. Daniel also made sure to check up on how I am doing throughout my trip - when we had issues communicating by text, he continued to keep in touch via email, which is much appreciated. 

The accommodations are as advertised. The room is cosy and looks out on Daniel's carefully cultivated garden. The lavatory and bathroom, which are separate, are exceptionally clean. The flat itself has close access to the public transit system should you opt not to ride a bike in Amsterdam. All in all, Daniel's flat is the perfect place to rest after a long day of sightseeing in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."
2818,47034916,2015-09-15,32431176,Esther,"I found the facility exactly as it is published. My stay was comfortable. Quite room, clean bathroom and I was allowed to use the living. He has really made it to me very easy with explaning everything I Needed during my stay in Amsterdam. Daniel's facility is located very good and one can reach most of the places using the public transportations at any time. I would like to extend my thanks to Daniel's person for his kindness, helping me when I Need help and caring about me. When I'll be in Amsterdam in the future I'll stay at his home. So I'll also recommend everyone of my friends and relatives to go there.  And last but not least; I wish that all Air B&B Provider can treat their guests as Daniel did with me.  "

A plus !!"

Das Zimmer war modern und komfortabel eingerichtet, super für einen kurzen Städtetripp. Besonders ausgefallen ist die Sauberkeit und die tolle Organisation von Daniel. Die Anbindung zur Innenstadt war angenehm und mit einem Tagesticket auch nicht zu teuer. Die Nachbarschaft ist eher ruhig, es gibt aber alle Geschäfte des täglichen Bedarfs. Wir kommen gerne wieder!"

Daniel is a very friendly host as he has a plethora of information about the city and is very responsive to email if there need be a problem. Even allowed an extra guest on our last nights stay without a charge or compliant. Would recommend his place anytime. "
2818,52624992,2015-10-31,46397401,Zheng Wei,"Daniel is a great host. On our arrival he prepared every kind of information for us, there's nothing he doesn't know about Amsterdam and even provided us with bikes. He has travelled a lot, it may be very interesting to hear some of his stories : )"

2818,53269669,2015-11-07,13310386,Jefferson,"Daniel made me feel very welcome from the very beginning, offering me a drink and a detailed overview of the city. He's a great guy and this apartment is very well decorated and spotless. He definitely has an eye for design. Daniel was very helpful. He answered every question I had, gave me extra blankets when I requested them, and even helped me hang my laundry!

The shower and bathroom are wonderful and close to the room you'd be staying at.

This listing is in Indische Buurt, which is a bit out of the way from everything else, but public transportation is fairly straightforward. The street itself is dark, but there weren't any instances where I felt unsafe. There are a few excellent restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the property.

Overall a great value and I really enjoyed my stay here!"

2818,68439590,2016-04-05,5580754,Eddie,"If I were going to become an Airbnb host, I would template as closely as possible Daniel's approach. I like the location, it adds to the experience of feeling local vs tourists. The city is an enjoyable walk and with Daniel's map easy tram and bus routes to an from everywhere.  His advice is spot on and as he listens to your interest books magically appear in your room.  The noise from the other residents is non existent.  The design and build obviously intended it this way.  Only noise on my stay were the birds outside my windows which if you weren't paying attention, you'd not even notice.  I plan on returning multiple times in the future to Daniel's.  "
2818,69227927,2016-04-10,58962573,Karin,"Daniel's var et godt eksempel på min forestilling om, hvornår et b&b bør fungere. Venlig modtagelse, god glidning om byen og seværdigheder. Pænt og rent overalt. Gode toilet og næstformand. Roligt kvarter tæt på transportmuligheder ind til centrum. Jeg følte mig meget velkommen.

I was well rested for each day's adventure. Daniel offered me some suggestions that were highlights of my time, including the Keukenhof gardens and the EYE Film Institute where I saw art films that would not be screened in my home town. I relied on his tour map (linking public transportation to main sights) more than my travel guide.  Daniel supplied me with electric water heater in my room so I could consume tea/coffee at my leisure, added some of my laundry to his own, showed me how to use (Hidden by Airbnb) map in real time and supplied me with a lanyard with his phone number (which I never used but was reassuring to have.

We felt immediately comfortable and welcomed, and confident that, during our three day visit, if we had any questions, Daniel would be there to help us. Indeed, on our first day, he emailed to check we were okay! We can't recommend Daniel highly enough!"

Daniel's apartment was cosy and extremely clean - I really appreciate how he took pride in the little details, such as allocating space for us to hang our bath towels and clearing our trash every day. It might be a little far to walk to the city centre but we rented bikes from him and also took the bus on the other days so it wasn't a problem. "

Sehenswürdigkeiten und Essen geben und war immer offen für unsere Fragen. Auch konnten wir gute Stadträder bei ihm kostengünstig leihen und direkt die Stadt erkunden. Werden bei Gelegenheit gerne wieder kommen!

I was super lucky to have found Daniel as my first airbnb experience but it's a shame to be so spoiled with his hospitality you rarely find genuine chareaterstics as of Daniels! He goes above and beyond all expectations. And like I told him myself I look up to such secure cleanthiness and warmth of heart!!
2818,93329396,2016-08-12,29802439,Andrew,Daniel was quick in reply to my initial booking request and provided further information about Amsterdam upon approving my request.

2818,101164053,2016-09-12,49335486,Bala Murali,"Everything was exactly as described in Airbnb website. A cozy and clean room, comfortable bed and good safety measures. A very quiet place to sleep and recharge the phone. Excellent Wifi speed. We found everything in his house was neat and Daniel has the eye for perfection and attention to details. Very well kept garden at the back of the house, immaculate clean toilet and shower.

Daniel gives you plenty of privacy and also is helpful should you need anything. This is a perfect place for someone busy who needs to feel at home after a long day at conference. Very informative guide provided by Daniel, ideal for first time visitors to Amsterdam. Very good neighborhood.

We found it an easy walk to the bus stops and tram stops and not far from the bars and restaurant. It is ideal location for us to go to RAI and also central via Rembrandt Square and Dam Square.

We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you Daniel."
2818,102834828,2016-09-19,91002807,Yueyang,"这一次的Airbnb体验,我真的没法挑剔,于是给了Daniel全部五星｡本来他是金牌房东,网上无一评价都超赞,我自己以前住过金牌房东的经历也很不错,于是我对他期待已经很高了,但最后Daniel和他的房间还是超出了我的预计!首先,房间非常干净｡主客都是脱鞋进屋,而地板确实一尘不染,让人也不忍破坏这种洁净｡其次,物品整齐有序,一应俱全,质量很好,比如床垫和枕头,比自家的还舒服;他连小音响都准备了,可以连接手机播放音乐｡再有房间设计和装饰风格我很喜欢,整体面积虽不大,但经他的设计,显得宽敞舒适,别具心裁,装饰和椅子都是他从其他国家运回来的,家里到处是植物,生机勃勃｡最后是他特别仔细贴心,他自制了地图和骑行指南,给我们解释时非常耐心,还准备了下午茶招待我们,是个很能聊的人,我最后很遗憾没能跟他交谈更多｡他推荐的景点和餐厅也很棒｡他房内还有很多惊喜,不剧透了,等你们去体验｡I would say Daniel and his house is awesome and beyond my expectation (even though I actually had quite high an anticipation), considering its flawless cleanness, elaborate decoration (combine with European and African), well-equipped room and his comprehensive guide, friendly and supportive manner. Everything seems perfect and staying in his house really made our journey more memorable. Those detailed surprises shall be revealed by the next lucky ones. Overall, 100% recommended."

From offering us a drink (and nibbles!) upon arrival to sending travel tips for trains AFTER we'd left for the airport, and everything in between, he was the perfect host. I had some issues with the bike we rented from him (I'm very short!!!) and he had got his tools out and adjusted the bike for me before I had even woken up on day 2. Just brilliant. Also, the house was impeccably clean!! A lovely, friendly and very easy-to-talk to man. Thank you so much, Daniel :) "

The apartment was very clean and I appreciated his welcoming note and vase of tulips. I felt comfortable  as a mature person travelling alone in this neighbourhood which is walking distance to restaurants, laundrettes and a supermarket. Daniel is great host.

2818,158529822,2017-06-07,64367573,Julio,"Daniel is an extremely pleasant person - an experienced traveller  himself. His room and service area (bathroom and toilets) are probably  the cleaner on thus planet- I really plan to indicate his name for the Nobel Prize, if the Sweddish Academy opens an airb&b competition... Serioysly now - we enjoyed his place a lot. The mattress of his bed is unbelievable - so confortable (I never trusted soft matresses- my back is very senstive). Riding a bike one can easily reach the central area within 20-30 min depending on your energy and wind factor. Thre is a nice park nearby (7 min). We had a fantastic spring wheather most if the time  (3/4 d) which obviously makes a difference. In two occasions we returned home at 1:15 am - it was safe and  fun.  If you are less lucky and must face cold  rain, the tram and bus are not too far, but you need a strong umbrella (Daniel will provide you if required). In summary - Enjoy his room because Amsterdam (with sun) is an urban paradise. Daniel is a privileged man..."

He's a very nice host and his place is absolutely and spotlessly clean (cleaner than hotels!). Like the previous travelers, we too, found the beds in the room to be supremely comfortable!
He was extremely meticulous and thorough and the directions he gave us to arrive at his house and also go about the city were very detailed and extremely helpful. 
The house is close to both bus and tram stops and the locality also seemed safe late at night. There are also a couple of restaurants and local bars around. 
We had a lovely stay. "

Upon arrival, he gave us a quick  tour of his place and it was incredibly clean and provided us with everything we needed and more. In fact, he left us with great guides on Amsterdam and info on how to get where we wanted. Location wise, his place is great, as everything we wanted to get to was within walking distance and close to the heart of Amsterdam.

As a host, I can't commend him enough. Any time we had a question, Daniel was more than willing to go out of his way to provide us with information about Amsterdam and was a tremendous help! I send infinite thanks to him for his outstanding hospitality and for letting us stay near the heart of Amsterdam for an absolutely great price!!"

2818,471406772,2019-06-17,82064994,Michelle,We had a great stay at Daniel’s place! He had so many helpful maps and tips for things to do and how to get around. The room and bathroom were incredibly clean (he cleaned the bathroom each day) and he did a load of laundry for us. Renting bikes from Daniel was very convenient and a great way to see the city. We would highly recommend Daniel- such a thoughtful and helpful host!!
2818,474577537,2019-06-23,199609327,Razvan,Daniel has been a wonderful host. The place is nice and clean. Daniel is very quick to respond to any queries.
2818,477377138,2019-06-28,8923210,Liz,"Daniel's place is really lovely, and he was an excellent host with good tips. I really appreciated him staying up for my late arrival, and he didn't make me feel uncomfortable creeping in at night or using the room to work. The folding table / desk in the room came in very useful! There are some lovely places to grab breakfast, dinner or a drink  just around the corner too :)  Cafe Chantilly is a must try."
2818,486731147,2019-07-13,16155483,Brian,I've stayed with a lot of hosts and Daniel stands out as probably the best organized and one of the most helpful. He had many useful tips to offer and guidebooks to borrow and was immediately and thoroughly responsive to questions. The room is exactly as it appears in the ad. The location in Zeeburg is great -- it's a cool neighborhood away from the hassle of the city center while still being only a short tram ride away. Highly recommended!
2818,489093562,2019-07-16,250234578,Marian,Above expectations.
2818,495480117,2019-07-26,220128053,Karen,"I highly recommend staying at Daniel's place.  He was a superb host, extremely helpful in navigating the city, recommendations of attractions in the area, comfortable beds, super clean.  He was very quick to respond to my messages regarding questions and gave wonderful suggestions and helpful tips.  I would stay with him again next time I visit Amsterdam.  He even messaged my husband and I the next day to find out how we slept the first night and if there was anything we needed.  Felt very comfortable and at ease while staying at his place.   I cannot say enough good things about Daniel's place and his helpfulness."
2818,497997495,2019-07-29,262880880,John,"Beautiful apartment, and Daniel was a very thoughtful and responsive host. Highly recommend!"
2818,503031131,2019-08-05,157035237,Ufuk,It was all good about Daniel’s place. Thank you for everything :)
2818,519210563,2019-08-28,62950521,Sébastien,"Very good stay, a pleasant place with comfy beds. Close to transportation. Daniel is very reactive and welcoming!"
2818,523206914,2019-09-03,275958549,Can,"The place is in a quiet spot, within minutes of cycling or public transport you can reach the city center. There are a lot of good restaurants near the place, so food is never a problem.
The park nearby is also beautiful and not crowded.
Daniel is a great host, who will help you with your trip.

I can only recommend this place"
2818,531398377,2019-09-17,95511875,Alfonso,"Daniel es un gran anfitrión. Cuida cada detalle, es muy atento de tus necesidades y tiene todo impecable."
2818,533248368,2019-09-21,245214095,Sophia,"Daniel went above and beyond to make us feel at home. Initially I wasn’t sure how I felt about the extra guest charge, but I am so so so glad we went with Daniel’s listing. He was responsive, attentive, and incredibly helpful. His home is centrally located in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood. It was immaculate with lots of cute little touches to make you feel nice and comfortable. In addition he made the check in process super easy and had a ton of information and insight to offer about the area. I will be staying here again next time I’m in Amsterdam!"
2818,540841317,2019-10-04,271440120,Cristina,Daniel is an excellent host.  The room was very clean; was quick to answer inquiries via email and text and offered helpful tips for getting around the area.
2818,546829261,2019-10-14,61906534,Issac,"This place is very clean, safe and the facilities are excellent. I would recommend staying here as a couple or even two friends for a lovely experience."
2818,551527260,2019-10-20,156086800,Thomas,"The host was very polite, and also helped is with our last minute check in time change. He also was well prepared and supplied us with a heap of information about local infrastructure and sightseeing targets. The room was clean and tidy. Overall, a pleasent stay, would definitely recommend."
2818,553400085,2019-10-24,303383524,Beth,Really satisfied beyond my expectation
2818,561003838,2019-11-08,15428796,Jonathan,I stayed in Daniels place for a few nights in November. It's about 15 minutes bus ride from Amsterdam central and a five minute walk. The room is as described. Daniel was very helpful (but leaves you in peace if you want that too) and I would recommend his place if you are not looking for a place for yourself. Thanks!
2818,567000584,2019-11-21,47472820,Austin,"Daniel is a great host. There were small touches like a beautiful hand written calligraphic note and nice flowers in the room to make it feel more homey. He provided much information about the local area, which is a nice neighborhood with great food and cafe options and not too far from the heavy bustle of the touristy areas. The apartment space is shared with Daniel, but it was never a problem. The whole space is sparkling clean."
20168,28186,2010-03-02,70091,Justin,"The location of Sasha's B&B makes it ideal for short Amsterdam visits; everything you might want to see is walkable. 

We stayed in the smallest room of the building, which was o.k. for the one night we spent. Our room was neat and clean, as was the bathroom. If you travel with more luggage and want to stay longer, make sure to book a bigger room. Unfortunately, on the site it's not quite clear how to choose the room you'll be staying in.

"
20168,59572,2010-07-01,114288,Jennifer,"The room was much smaller than in the picture, was filled with Mosquitos and was very hot. However, the host was friendly and let us check in an hour early, as well as let us use another rooms shower when our room wasn't ready yet."
20168,3568844,2013-02-18,4701293,Enrique,"The place was much better than I thought. Very nice room and the host was very friendly. Actually I didn't make too much use of the room, just came back to collect my luggage. I guess that's Amsterdam, :-)."
20168,9889567,2014-01-17,10560656,Francesca,"La camera non era quella delle foto, ma nel complesso era molto carina ed accogliente con vista sulla strada principale.
Purtroppo il nostro problema più grande è che abbiamo avuto la visita di un piccolo topo di città sotto il letto una delle sere in camera. La pulizia era buona, e il propietario è stato premuroso e disponibile in piena notte per aiutarci a risolvere il problema. In ogni caso credo che sia giusto comunicarlo qui, se pur spero che l'episodio non si ripresenti più...
Il bagno e molto piccolo e non ha riscaldamento, in più la piccola finestra è sempre aperta quindi fare la doccia ci è rimasto un pò complicato perchè faceva davvero molto freddo.
La posizione è senz'altro ottima poichè permette di raggiungere ogni attrazione a piedi senza utilizzare i costosissimi trasporti pubblici. Coffee shop, ristoranti italiani e argentini, souvenir, cinema e casinò nelle vicinanze."
20168,15747292,2014-07-15,9308037,Anastasya,"Alex was a wonderful host, very nice. The room was cozy, great if you're just looking to spend a weekend in Amsterdam because the location is close to everything! "

20168,21003565,2014-10-09,14877752,Eliza,"My stay at Alex's apartment was everything I needed it to be! The room was in a great location, close enough to walk to all the main attractions. The room was fairly small however the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The only thing bad about the room was that it was situated on a main road and the traffic noise was very loud throughout the night. Other than that, had a pleasant stay. Thanks Alex! "
20168,22435251,2014-11-06,22375949,Eugenia,"Il soggiorno trascorso in questa stanza è stato delizioso, l'ambiente é piccolo ma ci si muove bene, il bagno è condiviso ma nella privacy e discrezione totale. Il proprietario ci ha dotato di tutto ciò di cui avevamo bisogno, asciugamani e lenzuola pulite, saponi, phon e tv in camera e sopratutto il wi-fi. È in pieno centro, a un passo da tutte le cose più importanti da vedere in città e per gli spostamenti ha la fermata del tram sotto casa. È il posto ideale per vivere un week-end romantico o con  amici ad Amsterdam! Lo consiglio a tutti per l' ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo!!"
20168,23214498,2014-11-25,2683224,Andreia,"The room is really cosy and just in the middle of everything. Loved the location. Good shower and comfortable bed. Alex told us everything we needed to know when we arrived. Thank you for an excellent stay, Alex. We loved Amsterdam!"
20168,24494592,2014-12-29,24684928,Louise,"Really good room, just on the top of a small breakfast restaurant ! Perfectly located, just next to the Foam - we went there at the opening - and the flower market... Alex left guides for us and really welcoming. Thank you !"
20168,24964784,2015-01-04,10291565,Veronica,"The room is nice and in a very centric neighborhood. The bathroom is small but clean and functional. The room is really cosy and just in the middle of everything. Loved the location. Alex told us everything we needed to know when we arrived. Thank you for an excellent stay, Alex."
20168,25266085,2015-01-11,13073874,Coline,"The room is nice and in a very centric neighborhood. The bathroom is small but clean and functional. However this is not an ""airbnb"" sharing experience, we only saw Alex for 5 minutes when checked in so it's more of a hotel than a local house. Anyway we had a nice time there and can not complain aboout the service. Thanks Alex."
20168,25382686,2015-01-14,22619846,Rebeca,"Alugar um quarto com o Alex foi uma ótima experiência. 
O local é muito perto do centro de Amsterdam e de todas as outras coisas necessárias. 
Alex nos recebeu no horário combinado, nos mostrou o quarto, explicou tudo o que era necessário e nos deu um mapa da cidade.
Se voltar em Amsterdam, com certeza ficarei novamente em um dos quartos do Alex. "
20168,25593387,2015-01-20,23588641,Martin,"Awesome location in Amsterdam's city centre. Walking distance from every location, we did not use the tram in our whole stay.

The room is very comfortable and though it is in the city centre, at night you hear almost nothing from the outside."
20168,26335529,2015-02-09,19308683,Joshua,"The place is at a good location, near to the center.  The room was nice and quiet.  It has sturdy, hardwood floors, two locks for entry.  One lock is the main entrance, the other is for the room.  You get a key for both locks.

Two power strips for charging and other electrical needs.  Hangers and shelves to keep your clothes nice.  Flat screen monitor with remote control for entertainment.

The bed was very comfortable and kept me very warm through the cold night.

I would definitely stay here again.
"
20168,26632591,2015-02-16,16469411,Pascal,"Alex is a kind man who described us everything and gave us some tips.The room is in a great spot of Amsterdam with many bars and restaurants around. We assumed a nice, comfortable and clean room and our expectations have been fulfilled! The only negative point: The café at the ground floor started playing music at 6.30 in the morning. "
20168,26794841,2015-02-19,710151,Kelly,"I'd recommend this place! Great location, great price. The room was clean and in a central location. Also very close to the tram that takes you to Central Station. 

There are small/steep stairs up to the room. This was not a problem for us, but good to know for other travelers! 

The bathroom is connected to the room, but is not heated. Once you turn the hot water on, you are fine (but something to keep in mind for traveling during the winter). "
20168,27398306,2015-03-03,14208608,Flore,"The place was very close to the center, accessible by foot, we really enjoyed this proximity! It was clean and the bed was good. The bathroom was a little cold but during winter it's not that surprising. The breakfast place in the same building was perfect. It's pretty much like a hotel room. "
20168,27802184,2015-03-12,27577493,Anthony,"Unfortunately I was not met at the place when I arrived and started to get a bit worried. The receptionist in the hotel next door fortunately found his phone number and he explained that he had to go to hospital at short notice and a friend would let me in soon which he did.

But a comfy night after I asked for the heating to be put on,which seemed to be missing the second night.(Which came on early next morning)"
20168,27850829,2015-03-13,27906591,Julien,"Bien placé, propre et hôte accueillant. A recommander!"
20168,28166372,2015-03-19,13328278,Lee,"Happy with the room, it was nice. Would stay there again no problem. "
20168,28396007,2015-03-23,15192503,Natalie,"Vor Ort unkompliziert und der Beschreibung entsprechend,
Zuvor der Mailkontakt etwas anstrengend, um die genaue Adresse zu bekommen. Stellte aber als unbegründet heraus."

20168,30357614,2015-04-20,30947871,Jingyao,"very nice and cozy place,very clean. and near the tram station and the central"
20168,30387835,2015-04-21,16740497,Daniela,"Bella camera con bagno privato al secondo piano di questo palazzo classico di Amsterdam, vicinissima al mercato dei fiori. Alex è stato un pochino insistente per sapere l'ora esatta del check-in, e purtroppo noi abbiamo ritardato di un paio d'ora sulle nostre tabelle di marcia, avvisandolo ma sentendoci quasi sgridati. Consigliato, ma occhio ad avvisarlo sull'ora d'arrivo!"
20168,31770637,2015-05-10,6348846,Kathrin,"Alex met us at the expected time in the Apartment and gave us good directions and also Nice recommendations for Dinner. The  Studio is centrally located, Attraktions in walking distance, very clean and quiet although the Tram stops in front of the House. The bathroom is a bit small, but okay. We enjoyed our stay and will come back."

20168,32117388,2015-05-14,30292985,Hanne,"Alex was very friendly. The room was super clean and decent. Great location, everything is nearby and you don't need public transport."
20168,33512780,2015-05-29,31347731,Brunella,"La camera rispecchia esattamente quanto descritto. Il bagno è un po' piccolo, ma in ogni caso funzionale. La camera era pulita, e la posizione dello stabile a due passi dal centro, comodissima sia di giorno che di notte e adiacente ad un ottimo bar dove fare colazione con un buon caffè espresso.
Alex è stato molto gentile e disponibile.
Consigliato per visite brevi, in quanto tutti gli extra (lenzuola ed asciugamani puliti) hanno costi aggiuntivi per permanenze inferiori ai 7 giorni."
20168,33968757,2015-06-02,15711677,Jamie,"The room is very clean, bed is super comfortable and the duvet is very soft. Alex met me on time, helped me get acquainted with the space and then gave me a lot of privacy. The flat is in a great locations, close to many nice restaurants and for walking around the centre. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
20168,34522901,2015-06-09,379669,Eddie,"Great price and location.  Good bed, no street noise, good water pressure and hot water, shower is small.  Surprised how quiet the neighborhood was at night, but it was Monday.  STEEP stairs, narrow steps.  Best for the young and agile."
20168,35214855,2015-06-16,31344367,Mariana,Our stay in Amsterdam couldn't be better than this one. The room is very confortable and close to everything touristic. Just pretty good and amazing.
20168,35554468,2015-06-20,5363621,Valerie,The place is well located and the room is clean.the wifii didnt work properly on our iphones but thats pretty much the only thing we have to say.I would recommand this place.
20168,35798262,2015-06-22,31710574,Riona,"We had a very warm welcome with detailed directions from Alex, and he availed himself to answer all our questions. The room was lovely and had everything we needed and the best part was the location, the tram stop is right outside! I would recommend this to fellow travellers. Thank you Alex for a lovely stay in Amsterdam, we really had an unforgettable time."
20168,36022306,2015-06-24,9814509,Haley,"Our stay was great! The room is beautiful and is in a great location. Alex was there to meet us with the keys and answer any questions we had. If I find myself back in Amsterdam, I would definitely stay again. The wifi didn't work very well but other than that, not a complaint to be had!"
20168,36269703,2015-06-27,28586568,Danielle,"Great location, clean room, comfy bed. Thank you Alex!"
20168,36668541,2015-06-30,29963216,Chelsea,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Alex's apartment for 2 nights. We were due to arrive at 1.30pm, however missed our flight so didn't arrive until 3.15pm. When I messaged Alex that morning to explain that we would be a couple of hours late because of a missed flight, I got the reply 'well thanks for ruining my plans!!!!!' While I could understand us being late would be annoying for him, this was not a very nice response. 
However, once we did get there, we really enjoyed our stay at the apartment!
The bedroom was big, the bed was super comfortable, and the place was very clean. It was in a great location-central, with a tram station right outside if needed. Alex included a map and some touristy information when checking in. The wifi didn't work very well, but the rest of the apartment made up for it. We would recommend this airbnb. 

"
20168,37141915,2015-07-05,29872225,Darryll,Alex was an excellent host. He greeted us and gave us a quick overview of rules and things we needed to know about our location.  Alex was excellent with communication and always responded my texts promptly. The house is centrally located and very convenient. He was wonderful as my first Airbnb experience and I would absolutely stay with him again.  
20168,37464943,2015-07-07,32834438,Morgan,The room is at a great location and very easy to get to from Central Station. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend. 
20168,37649849,2015-07-09,19533921,Sean,"Alex's house is extremely central and the bed is the highlight of the rooms, extremely comfortable. Alex accommodated our request for evening check-in and provided maps and tourist information for the city. However, the Wi-Fi signal is weak and could be strengthened and the stairwell to the rooms is steep, narrow and has low headroom.  Knowing this, I would stay here again and recommend it to friends."
20168,38258194,2015-07-14,29888294,Brittany,"Beautiful flat in Amsterdam! It was the perfect location. Alex was there to greet us and was very helpful. The internet was slow, but overall I would definitely recommend this flat. "
20168,38833169,2015-07-19,22777843,Saraf,"Alex was a lovely host. The location is excellent, walking distance to many attractions. We really enjoyed our stay."
20168,39291352,2015-07-22,10081816,Manasi,"Alex's place was in a great location, walking distance from everywhere. The apartment was very nicely furnished and quiet despite being on a main road. We enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to others! "
20168,39612572,2015-07-25,14250811,Laura,"Central location - walking distance to almost everything! 
There is a bar fridge however there isn't any kitchen facilities or bowls/cutlery etc so this is only really useful if you wanted to keep drinks cold etc unless you bring your own utensils. We ate breakfast down stairs at the local cafe as we were told we would get a special discount if we mentioned we were staying with Alex - for two breakfasts we only got a 1 euro discount that, for a 28 euro bill, wasn't that much in the scheme of things. I would recommend exploring elsewhere as we found you could get much cheaper breakfasts at other cafes around Amsterdam. However, this cafe wasn't bad and the coffee was yum. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable. Alex gave us a quick run down of everything on the first day and then was never to be seen again which, to be honest, was nice as it felt like we weren't sharing with anyone! It's like a studio apartment minus the kitchen and laundry! Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thank you Alex."
20168,39926678,2015-07-27,33119605,Bijal,"The room was pleasant and clean. Bed was comfortable. Location was very good and central to site seeing in Amsterdam. However it was on a main road so we could hear the road with the window open. 
Shower was good temperature and easy to use, however just be aware the bathroom itself is very very small (a larger sized person might struggle)
Meant to meet Alex at 12, we arrived few minutes early,  rang the doorbell and continued to ring it intermittently over the next 30 minutes.  He did not respond and we had to ask the hotel next door to use the wifi so we could contact him. We were waiting outside in the rain and when he opened the door, he didn't seem very apologetic and made a comment that because we arrived early he wasn't to hear the doorbell.He didn't offer to help with our bags,  and again for anyone considering this air bnb should be aware the stairs are spiralling, narrow and steep. Once in the room, he went through information with us and was very quick to get the city tax from us and ask when we would check out. He did ask us if we had any more questions and gave us the opportunity to ask however because of how.our interaction begun,  we felt we couldn't really ask. Overall I would not rate this place for hosting skills to enhance your experience when visiting Amsterdam as we found it very transactional and impersonal and as if we were a burden however the room itself is perfectly pleasant and good if your just looking for a place to stay."
20168,41066184,2015-08-04,6565851,Marcus,We had a marvelous stay in Amsterdam and a nice room. The location is perfect and it's easy to reach all important and less important sightseeing places. However please keep in mind the room is located next to a big street with its typical traffic and noise. Nevertheless we enjoyed our stay! Thank you!
20168,41364608,2015-08-07,34608309,Natalie,The location of this apartment is perfect. Walkable distance to everything and we loved the bakery below. Alex was extremely nice and helpful. The place was very modern and clean. We highly recommend to anyone staying in Amsterdam.

A recommander "
20168,42707978,2015-08-15,33905504,Nigel,"A  cheerful welcome from Alex, information about getting around the city and quick tour of the dos and don'ts. The room and ensuite are great and the traffic noise no problem.
Don't be put off by an apartment close to the centre; Amsterdam is a wonderfully compact, clean and friendly city with millions of clean, quiet bicycles. Pretty much everyone speaks English (and they aren't offended if you don't speak Dutch) and are incredibly helpful.
You can hire a bike, but the combination of :  millions of others, other side of the road, an unfamiliar bike and maybe a beer or two is not likely to be relaxing. The city is small enough to explore on foot or buy a day ticket for the brilliant public transport system.
Have fun, Nigel"
20168,43360267,2015-08-19,22372373,David,This place was fantastic. Walking distance from everything you'd want to visit in Amsterdam! Alex was very efficient and helpful. Would stay here again ! 
20168,44316495,2015-08-25,37838735,Natalie,"The room is exactly as pictured, a small but bright and comfortable room.  Do note that the bathroom is quite small but manageable.  Alex's friend met us to check in and was at least 30 minutes late.  That being said, Alex was easily reachable by phone and resolved the situation.  The bed was very comfortable and we had a great stay in this place.  Would stay again and would highly recommend!"
20168,45102126,2015-08-31,10068148,Andy,"The host turned up on time to hand over the keys and explain a few things. The location is very central. The noise is not too bad considering it is on one of the main streets with trams. Towels, shampoo and soap were provided."
20168,45953666,2015-09-07,4126783,Leandra,The studio is exactly as described. Alex was there to give us the keys and explain everything. The bathroom is very small but it's alright for a short stay. My friend and I really enjoyed staying there and I would recommend this place to everyone who plans a short stay in Amsterdam and wants to live central.
20168,48163897,2015-09-24,32938213,Nathan,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Everything was as promised. It is close to all the main attractions and we found we walked everywhere during our three night stay. It is approx 5-10mins walk to Dam Square. The room is roomy, well furnished, and had good security having to enter through two lockable doors. The bed is very comfortable, not to soft but not rock hard either. It has a cosy shower and toilet that is your own. There was little to no noise during the day or night. Alex was friendly and provided us with the information we needed. Next time we visit Amsterdam we will definitely be staying here. Great work Alex. Stayed as a couple from Sydney Australia."
20168,49598551,2015-10-05,35534159,Carly,"Lovely room, great location. The bed was really comfortable and room very spacious. Shower was  nice and hot. Five minutes walk to shops and restaurants. Only thing would say negatively is that the room lighting is very dim so we found it difficult to get ready in the evening, and the Internet signal was not great."
20168,49907901,2015-10-07,43357448,Tegpal,"Alex is very nice, helpful, and informative. The room was nice and cozy. It was very quiet and peaceful. There is a coffee shop below, which is very convenient. Everything is walking distance and the tram stops right in front of the house. The only thing was we heavily relayed on WiFi, but the signal was very low and you would only get WiFi in certain areas of the room."
20168,50165898,2015-10-10,32962059,Sarah,"Really loved Amsterdam and the apartment made it all the more enjoyable for us. It's very centrally located, so we didn't use transport once other than to and from the station. It was clean, and spacious. The bathroom is slightly small, but we knew that up front and it didn't make the stay unbearable at all. Alex accommodated us with an early check in for no additional costs and was easily accessible throughout our stay. He was very welcoming and forthcoming with information about Amsterdam to make our stay better! Thanks for an amazing experience Alex."
20168,50627859,2015-10-13,40345406,Avril,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights and it was ideal. The location meant we could walk everywhere around the city although the metro did stop right outside. Lovely, clean apartment. Would definitely recommend staying here. "
20168,50777582,2015-10-14,44488161,Dorian,"I enjoyed the stay at Alex's place. The room was clean, smart and well presented. Handy for central Amsterdam, and handy for breakfast.. Alex was very accommodating even when I ended up running late to meet him. Will most likely use the room again."
20168,51718232,2015-10-24,33604452,Vera,"La habitacion es tal cual se muestra en la foto. Con un baño pequeño. Esta muy bien ubicado, cerca de todo. En una avenida muy transitada con lugares lindos para pasear y comer. Alex nos explico todo y fue muy amable. Recomendamos."
20168,52062418,2015-10-26,35320132,George,"Alex' s place is in an ideal location for a visit to Amsterdam because of the great central location,  
Alex was very helpful in accommodating my daughter and her boyfriend on their first trip away on their own and the security of the property helped to make them feel safe and very comfortable 
Highly recommended "
20168,52321993,2015-10-28,22473069,Lisa,"The listing was as described; simple and clean, w Windows that were able to block out the noise from below. We were located close to many of the more important sites Amsterdam, but i think staying in a quieter and less touristy spot may have be preferable.  

Alex was rather unpleasant to work with. He wanted to know the ""exact"" time we would be arriving in Amsterdam, which can be somewhat difficult when traveling.  He seemed agitated and rushed, and his entire demeanor left us w an unpleasant feel for our surroundings. "
20168,52421511,2015-10-29,44686127,Laura,"Alex was a gracious host and the room is just as the picture. The location is fantastic, close to everything and the city is very easy to navigate. Alex was also very helpful with suggestions! "
20168,52987115,2015-11-03,32949479,Tom,"The apartment is in a great location and is perfect for a city break on a budget. Alex was very friendly and welcoming despite the fact we were late for check-in (air bnb's map led us slightly astray for finding the door - it's further from the corner than the map suggests but is clearly  numbered, we were just being a bit absent minded)."
20168,53463432,2015-11-09,43153224,Nicole,"Alex was extremely welcoming, waiting up for us due to our late arriving flight. When we did finally arrive, he showed us our room, explained how everything worked and gave us a map of Amsterdam, telling us where the best places to go were. He was very helpful!"
20168,53961073,2015-11-15,36887696,Charlie,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at Alex's. Even though we arrived early, Alex was very welcoming and was happy to show us around our room. We were given a map and showed the best places  to visit/eat and Alex even gave us an adapter because we forgot to bring our own. This apartment is very conveniently located, we walked everywhere and only got a tram once from the station when we first arrived. The bed was extremely comfy and the shower was really good too. Alex even put up a little Christmas tree which made the room look even nicer. We would definitely stay here again if we returned to Amsterdam! :)"
20168,54788311,2015-11-23,11226673,Camille,"This room is perfect for a short stay in Amsterdam. Great location in the city center, nice quarter, quiet and safe. The room was very comfortable, warm and welcoming. Alex has been a very nice host. I definitely recommend this place. "
20168,54988317,2015-11-27,45592471,Luke,"Alex was very welcoming and helpful. The room is in a great location, it has a cafe underneath which is ideal for breakfast. The room was amazing, exactly what the pictures looked like. Bed was really comfortable and nice bedding. Room is perfect for a short break to Amsterdam!"
20168,55394687,2015-12-01,7447604,Asli,"The flat is at a very convenient location, in walking distance to many attractions as well as the city centre, and if you feel like taking the tram there is a station right in front of the building, which was practical on the way from and to the train station, with the luggages. I was arriving early and Alex was nice enough to let me check in earlier. The private bathroom is a plus, it's a small one but there's nothing too inconvenient, especially for a short stay. There's a small fridge in the room as well, and everything was clean and neat. The apartment is on one of the main streets but the room was impressingly quiet at night. "
20168,55942223,2015-12-07,6225300,Samanta,"Accomodation true to the description and photos - very nice interior, if windows closed - very silent and can't hear any street noise. Very central as well - everything seemed a walk away and we saw a lot of Amsterdam by foot. Bedding super comfortable ! Alex was very friendly and ready to help ! The little café downstairs is a nice plus. Thank you for the wonderful long weekend."
20168,56236513,2015-12-11,14217618,Adam,My wife and I stayed 2 nights at Alex's listing and the location was amazing barely a 5 minute walk from the centre of Amsterdam. Our train arrived late which I feel terrible about holding Alex up but he was lovely and very understanding he gave us a run down of how things worked and left us be. The room was huge and bed was amazingly comfortable. Would stay again in a heart beat and highly recommend.
20168,56483271,2015-12-14,31639419,Bobbi,"Alex was welcoming and helpful. The room was just as we expected and in a great location in Amsterdam in the middle of all the main attractions, nothing was too far. Would definitely stay here again if I returned to Amsterdam. Thanks alex x "
20168,56724846,2015-12-17,15393234,Ethel,This was a cosy place in an excellent location. Enjoyed being able to walk everywhere we needed and the bed was very comfortable. Only little issue was the 5% city tax at the start which we weren't aware of as its not on the listing but it was a small fee and we let Alex know to clarify for next time. Other than that it was a nice little convenient space. 
20168,58800768,2016-01-05,21149265,Steven,"By far the best lodging experience I have ever had! All the reviews before me about Alex and the place was right on. The location of the place is great, short walking distance to Amsterdam's flower market and on the major trams way. Alex was very professional, explanatory from the beginning I contacted him and during my stay. The room was exactly how it was described in the pictures and extremely clean. I would definitely stay there if I go back to Amsterdam again. Thanks again to Alex and Airbnb for helping with my stay!"
20168,58972549,2016-01-05,30958054,Emma,"The room looks exactly like the photos, the bed is very comfortable and big. Perfect location, you can walk everywhere."
20168,59278562,2016-01-09,45277297,Mattia,The room was like the photos! Very clean and big enough for two persons. Perfect location you have all around the room without take any transport. We would definitely stay there if we go back to Amsterdam again. Thanks Alex!
20168,59573618,2016-01-12,29987475,Hannah,Thanks for a fantastic few days. The apartment was very clean and beautifully furnished. Great location with everything in walking distance. Alex was very helpful and flexible. Would definitely recommend for a short break in Amsterdam!  
20168,59704008,2016-01-14,36703304,Ashley,"The location of the room is very good. And the space of the room was quite big. But the bathroom is very small and cold. Also, the communication was not very pleasant. I've been living in 10+ airbnb and this host is by far the worst one. He seems to be impatient about answering my questions and explaining things in detail."
20168,60004137,2016-01-18,4624591,Anton,"We stayed one night on a layover.

Alex was friendly and easy to get in touch with. He waited for us at the apartment, talked us through various things such as using the shower, the keys, and other things, and left us to explore the city. As we were in Amsterdam for only one night, we didn't need to get in touch with him a lot, but for those few times that we had to talk to him, he promptly responded by text.

In general, the room was comfortable. The bed was great, and, although we didn't need to use it, it was good to know that we had access to a mini-fridge. 

Our only concern was the bathroom. The toilet seat was located so high that it wasn't very comfortable to use. My girlfriend's feet, for instance, could not reach the floor when she was sitting down. We didn't mind this problem too much because we stayed at the room for such a short amount of time, but someone who stays there longer might find the toilet to cause them more discomfort.

So, while I would recommend this place for a short visit to Amsterdam, I don't know if one would find it comfortable to deal with the bathroom on a longer trip."
20168,60765659,2016-01-27,27928859,Sarah,"Loved everything about Alex's place! Excellent communication, perfect location and everything was clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying here if you are in Amsterdam!"
20168,60912667,2016-01-29,20031193,Céline,Just like the photos. Very well located and perfectly clean. Perfect to stay a couple of days in Amsterdam.
20168,61168054,2016-02-01,50892280,Tom,"Absolutely loved our stay here. Perfect location, everything's within walking distance. The room was just like the photos, very cosy and the bed was comfortable. It's above a nice little cafe too - the hallway always smelled of coffee. Alex met us when we arrived and was really helpful in talking us through everything. Will most likely stay here again in the future. "
20168,61375350,2016-02-03,51353381,Joni,"The room was identically like the pictures. The location couldn't be better. No need for public transport, everything is in walking distance. Alex gave us a quick tour, a map and showed us the main areas to visit. There's also a little café underneath the room where you can have breakfast. We had a nice time!  "
20168,61439175,2016-02-04,28154632,Debora,"The room was very nice and clean (exactly as it looks on all the pictures). Centrally located, which was a huge plus! Small downsides of the room were the not so very strong wifi connection, not being able to store or luggage after check-out, and the cold bathroom. Alex also wasn't there when we checked out, and he never answerred on the text message we sent when we left. Therefore we had to assume everything was okay. Even though there was no possibility of storing our luggage for the rest of the day after we checked out, Alex suggested we asked to store it at the cafe on the ground floor right under the room. It was a really cosy cafe where we had a coffee, smoothie and breakfast and the lady was kind enough to store our bags until closing time. If I go back to Amsterdam, I would definitely consider going back to this Airbnb! "
20168,61799938,2016-02-08,15578964,Ching-Wen,"We didn't have the opportunity to meet Alex. It was his friend coming to meet us. The room was great, good location, clean and spacious. Highly recommended."
20168,62073062,2016-02-11,39628821,Samm,"A cosy apartment in close distance to everything the centre of Amsterdam has to offer: a stones throw away from the Flower Market and Museum quarter. 

The bed is super comfortable, and the room is decorated to a high standard. The fridge is a welcome addition, perfect for storing drinks and a few goodies. 

Alex was a great host, and very accommodating. He provided us with a map and orientated us as well as giving us tips on where to go. Although we didn't need him, it's great to know he's available to answer queries 24/7. Thank you Alex! 

In Amsterdam, it's worth visiting the Artis Zoo. We also discovered the Dutch Resistance Museum close by the Zoo, which provides a poignant insight into Amsterdam in World War 2- a must to visit.  

The only downside was the small bathroom: the toilet is a little high for those challenged with height, and the shower a little small. This didn't impact our time at all, and being on a short break meant the bathroom was not of massive concern. 

Finally, have euros prepared for the tourist tax to pay upon arrival. 

In all, a wonderful apartment to have spent our time in Amsterdam. "
20168,62817986,2016-02-17,54321458,Emilie,"Petit endroit très charmant, très bien placé, avec mon copain nous avons vécu un très bon séjour, et nous nous sentions chez nous dans cette chambre. Je recommande vivement. "
20168,63077213,2016-02-20,12452297,Brian,"We stayed in Alex's studio for 3 nights. Alex was friendly and helpful greeting us with a map and showing us all major tourist places and where to go, etc.
The studio is in a really great location in the centre of Amsterdam, walking distance from everywhere but you can take the tram right outside the apartment door either."
20168,63715340,2016-02-26,13586559,Grace,"Our host was very helpful although he asked me to pay the city tax in cash to him at check in, even though I had already paid it through AirBNB. I thought this was a bit sketchy as really AirBNB hosts should never ask for extra cash without having disclosed that up front. When I explained I already paid it he didn't press it but I still thought it was unprofessional. However the room is as it looks and as the description says, it's very comfortable and great location. "
20168,64894071,2016-03-08,12452529,Isabel,"Wir haben Anfang März 2 Nächte bei Alex übernachtet.
Die Kommunikation  vorher  und während unseres Aufenthalts war sehr gut, freundlich und unkompliziert.
Das Zimmer war sauber und und mit allem ausgestattet was man für einen Kurztrip braucht. Das Badezimmer ist sehr klein aber auch vollkommen ausreichend.
Die Lage ist perfekt um die Stadt zu Fuß oder mit dem Fahrrad zu erkunden. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt  in Amsterdam wieder bei Alex übernachten.
Wir waren sehr zufrieden. "
20168,65152845,2016-03-11,5281612,Taylor,"Alex was a great host. He worked with us because we had an usually early arrival into Amsterdam and was welcoming from the moment we arrived at his house. 

The room is very close to everything in the city center. It is about a 5-15 minute walk or tram ride to nearly every place of interest in the city. And if you choose to take the tram, there is a stop directly in front of Alex's entrance. 

Alex provided us with a map of Amsterdam and gave us some advice, but left us alone to explore thereafter. He was always available if we needed to contact him though. 

The bathroom was quite small, though this seems to be common in Holland and the street grew louder at night the closer it got to the weekend. But overall no complaints. Would definitely stay here again. "
20168,65811006,2016-03-17,46793178,Robin,"Alex met us when we arrived and showed us around and explained the keys.  This was a bit rushed, but was very clear; and when I called a few minutes later with a question he'd already answered he was very kind. 
The bed and linens are nicer than in my own home, so that was a treat!  The bedroom is spacious and the bathroom is tiny but has everything you need, including plenty of hot water. 
The location is ideal: easy walking distance to the major museums and historic Amsterdam.  We had a wonderful time and would happily stay here again on future trips to Amsterdam."
20168,68969403,2016-04-08,6251143,Philippe,"Lovely location. Very central, perfect to visit  Amsterdam's center. 
The kitchen equipment is a bit minimal, but good stay overall."
20168,70766106,2016-04-20,43282692,Bernice,"Room as described, very comfortable bed and spacious room. Bathroom a bit tight but everything worked properly. There is also a Fridge which is an asset. Tram stop just in front of the place which is very comfortable. 

We didn't meet Alex but his friend Jan came to greet us, very helpful and kind person . He gave us some special tips and places to visit and kept contact till the end. 

The only things I would add to this place considering that it's not a cheap place are an electric kettle and some cups and glasses. The shower curtain should be changed into a glass one as it's very annoying having it sticked  with you while you're showering in a small shower . I don't find it fair to have to pay for the towels and linen if you need them to be changed before 4 days or so (I don't exactly remember the days ) . 

Please note that I would still book this place if I make it back to amsterdam . :)"
20168,72804162,2016-05-04,23461037,Annamalai,The flat was clean and comfortable.
20168,75050196,2016-05-18,5455279,Stephen,"Apartment is just as described and the bed is quite comfortable! Location is perfect - we were able to walk to everything... Shopping, nightlife, restaurants, the canals, etc. Very convenient. Only minor downside was that the bathroom is tight - but other than that, was very enjoyable!"
20168,76579129,2016-05-28,6376086,Yee Tzen,"I've stayed in 2 or 3 star hotels in Amsterdam hotel before and budget wise, staying here definitely was worth the money.  The room was very clean and spacious, bed was comfortable, location was central (tram stop was literally a couple steps outside the door but with the beautiful weather that day we just walked around Amsterdam instead) and Alex was friendly and super prompt to reply us whenever we needed anything! Also loved the fact that there was a lovely quaint little cafe just downstairs which served good coffee and cakes.

Only down side was that as with any typically older buildings in Amsterdam, the sound proofing wasn't great.  So you could hear your neighbours walking above you in the middle of the night.  And it would've been nice if there was a kettle in the room.  But all things that were bearable during our stay. 

Would still definitely recommend staying here anytime.  "
20168,77782320,2016-06-03,20014452,Lynda,"
Flat was as described. Location was great with tram stop right outside. Our flight was delayed by an hour so we exchanged texts with Alex (who lives above) and his hand over was therefore a bit rushed but it was clear. Tight spiral staircase to flat but rail to hold onto. Bed large and comfortable. Bathroom very small but adequate. Would have loved a kettle and mugs so we could make a hot drink and glasses that fit under the tap to drink water.  Fridge was a bonus. Cafe for coffee/breakfast is next door and plenty of eating places nearby.  Make sure you get the hang of the window opening as it's a bit stiff."
20168,81080380,2016-06-20,62658340,Edith,"The apartment was in a very well placed neighborhood, with easy acces to the tram and other transports, very clean, Alex was always very helplfull."
20168,81709189,2016-06-24,21381378,Wesley,"As described. Perfect, central location. "
20168,84615779,2016-07-08,20817847,Monica,"When I got there he yelled at me for being late 1 hour. I apologize and tried to talk him that our flight was delayed 45 mins, and then it tooks is a bit to find internet to find the location of the place. He talked again at me and told me that I should've called or sent a message. Very rude!"
20168,86059225,2016-07-14,41095073,Jakob,"We were in Amsterdam for the first time.
The room was as described. The location is very central and easy to find. A tram stop is right in front of the door. The staircase is spiral and very narrow (not easy to get bigger suitcases up). The room itself is located on the second floor. Double bed - very large and very comfortable. The bathroom is very small but clean and well maintained with a small window. There is also a small fridge available and some glasses.
A Café is located directly downstairs in the building with good breakfast offers.
Only Con was that only one window in the room can be opened (and that only tilted). WiFi has adequate speed (you can choose from 3 Accesspoints).
Our host Alex was nice and friendly and gave us a quick introduction to the appartment and Amsterdam in general. Overall it was a great stay and a top location to discover the city."
20168,87043602,2016-07-18,4569457,Anna,It was really nice stay in Alex place. The place has perfect location and is very clean and comfortable. We had great contact with Alex from the moment I booked the room till the moment we left. He was very responsive and helpful. He even made room available a bit earlier which was great! There is a fridge in the room and all the basics. This place is definitely worth recommendation!
20168,89384339,2016-07-28,10338787,Paul,Great location and place! Everything was super easily accessible by walking. It was really nice of Alex to give us the rundown on places to hit up and things to watch out for when we first checked in.
20168,89839520,2016-07-30,14326039,Annabelle,"Petite chambre très bien placée dans Amsterdam.
Nous avons passé 2 jours en amoureux. C était parfait!
Alex est sympathique et arrangeant. 
Merci!"
20168,96701418,2016-08-24,79747516,Federico,Muy buena experiencia!! Excelente ubicación y muy confortable la cama.. Algo pequeño el baño pero con muy buena ducha... Volveremos!! 
20168,98381268,2016-08-30,21741210,Manuel,"My girlfriend and I had a nice stay at the room Alex is offering, we didn't meet Alex in person though. The Place is close to the center and the tram/bus stop so the place is great if you are looking for a central space to sleep. It doesn't have the personal touch and flair of a private apartment, more of a hostel room. I guess it was built just for airbnb purposes. We can recommend it anyways to all sorts of travellers!"
20168,98646182,2016-09-01,22765498,Cedric,"A perfect room, so clean and especialy the location, few minutes walk from all the sightseeing, and a trmway stop just nxt to the door, i will definitely book it again."
20168,99456743,2016-09-04,49952788,Jess,"Alex's place was amazing! He was away at the time, but Connor greeted us and he was very friendly and welcoming :) 
The room itself was great. Spacious enough for two people, with anything you could need. The bed was incredibly comfortable. 
The location of the room is perfect, so easy to walk to everywhere we wanted to go. So many restaurants and bars nearby and only like a 10 min walk right into the centre of Amsterdam. 
Thanks so much to Alex and Connor for having us stay, we would definitely stay there again :) "
20168,100671263,2016-09-10,76436368,Daniel,"Room was very nice - good location and nice size room for Amsterdam.  Alex was responsive, and his friend met us at the door and helped with the bags.  Room was very clean and comfortable, like staying in a hotel.  Would stay here again!"
20168,102797875,2016-09-19,87205051,Niklas,"Lovely and cozy appartment with walking distance to ""almost everything"" the city of Amsterdam has to offer. We didn't need to use any money on public transportation during our stay. The only con with the appartment is the ventalation. 
There was only one window we could open for fresh air, and the appartment felt really warm on several occasions. "
20168,105228350,2016-09-30,13221915,Diana,"The room is nice and clean. There is enough space and although it faces a busy street the windows do its job to keep the noise out. The bathroom is a bit smaller but manageable for a few days stay. The shower varied in temperature and pressure, but also okay. Conor, who was there at our arrival was very pleasant and helpful, which was a great surprise because from my previous communications Alex (the host), was impatient in settling the check in time and when I kindly asked if it was possible to change it, he said ""too many changes, fine now but will not change anymore"". I thought that was rude since I had not asked to change it before. But anyway, we ended up not meeting him and that's why I said meeting Conor was a nice surprise. The location is great. I recommend it!"
20168,106248873,2016-10-05,95339144,Nathan,"Was great staying at the apartment, was only 10 minutes into dam square so the location was ideal. 

The bathroom was a little small and there was a problem with one of the windows. We also found that there wasn't much lighting in the room. This aside, the room and bathroom were very clean with all the essentials provided, and the bed was comfortable.

Alex was away during our stay so we checked-in with Conor who was very friendly and more than willing to help and answer any questions we had. 

We would certainly stay here again on our next trip to Amsterdam.


"
20168,108465506,2016-10-16,2143937,Eldar,"Alex was very welcoming, gave instructions how to get to the place, met me at the door and was generally very friendly. I never had any issues during my one week of stay. The studio is situated in a very convenient location and right next to it is a very vibrant area with bars, restaurants and such. Other places are also very accessible. I would recommend staying there. Would recommend staying there."
20168,109101247,2016-10-19,11421758,Jenny,He allowed us to check in an hour earlier which was awesome ! The neighbourhood was great ! Close to everything ! Apartment was clean and perfect for 2 people ! I would definitely recommend to stay here !
20168,109701581,2016-10-23,63977631,Avril,"I felt like we were lucky to stay in such a central location! We walked out the door, turned right, and just a block away were plenty of restaurants, bars, and shopping. The apartment is practically around the corner from Rembrandt Square! 
The only thing that put a damper on the trip was when I communicated that our train had been delayed and would get in at 7:30 instead of 4:30, still within the original 2-10pm check-in guidelines. Alex's immediate response was that we were pretty much SOL because he would not be home and there was no way for us to get the keys to our room. Eventually he was able to get a friend to wait for our arrival in order to let us in, show us our room and explain all the rules. However, he charged us extra money for the inconvenience.  It took a lot of back-and-forth texting to get to that point. I was stressing out.  I think that it would be nice if he had a contingency plan in case of delays that are out of the guests' control.
Once we got settled everything was fine. The room is more spacious than I expected, the bed is comfortable, and we were glad to have a TV. The bathroom is a little small but has good water pressure.  It was like a hotel room with no access to other areas of the house, and that was fine with us. I would recommend staying there and being careful to make sure your arrival time is accurate. You might want to give yourself a little cushion to account for arriving, not just the time your flight or train gets in, because he won't wait around for long and might try to charge you for making a change.  But again, the location is just perfect for walking out the front door and getting to explore the center of the city by walking or biking.  Have fun!"
20168,110252787,2016-10-25,27994142,Juliette,The studio's location in the center of Amsterdam is absolutely perfect to visit the city and the room is very nice and clean. We spent a great weekend there. 
20168,110400688,2016-10-26,17378523,Yolanda,"convenient location, easy to get everywhere and tram station just in front of house. "
20168,110868013,2016-10-29,94798754,Milen,"Unbeatable location, walking distance to all major touristic sights. It was easy to get the keys. The studio was clean. It had a TV, WiFi, a small fridge and I tiny private bathroom. "
20168,112114551,2016-11-04,54720840,Tim,"A representative of our host was waiting for us at the agreed time, made us welcome, showed us the amenities and gave us keys."

20168,113642504,2016-11-13,22472820,Leticia,"Destaco la ubicación como lo mejor! Llegas andando a todos los sitios claves para visitar, y muy bien comunicado! La habitación estaba limpia y con mucha privacidad! En las fotos parece más grande que lo que es pero en Amsterdam las viviendas son pequeñas! El baño muy pequeño pero con todo lo necesario y muy limpio! Alex fue muy amable y nos acogió muy bien estando disponible siempre para todo lo que necesitáramos! Sin duda repetiremos! "
20168,113865253,2016-11-14,11907992,Stephanie,Great location 
20168,114264084,2016-11-17,70002084,Dominique,"The room was beautiful, very clean and the bed was big and very comfortable. Had a lovely stay. The bathroom is small but has everything we needed and there was even shampoo and body wash although we had brought our own. It was also nice and warm even though it was freezing cold outside which was good. Only negative was the host was slightly abrupt over messaging after a very small misunderstanding prior to arrival which made us a bit apprehensive about arrival but we were met by Connor who was lovely and had no further issues! "
20168,115018004,2016-11-21,43190075,Francesco,"Quite apartment in the City center of Amsterdam, it's perfect for a couple and the host it's very hospitality and have disponibiliy abou request of the guest. I was here with my girlfriend and i suggest "
20168,115862443,2016-11-27,39640578,John,Great room in an excellent location. The whole process was very friendly and straightforward. 
20168,116422989,2016-11-30,7626305,Teresa,"Great stay. Host was helpful and told us everything we needed to know about the apartment. Extremely comfortable and a great location. Within walking distance of everything in Amsterdam! Bed was comfortable, good showerhead and good tv! Just make sure to check if the windows are actually closed during the winter since there is a counter-intuitive vent on top of the windows. It got left open and it took us a while to figure out why the room was so cold despite the heater being on high--not fun in November--but once we figured it out the room got nice and cozy!"
20168,120276248,2016-12-09,99431047,Madeleine,"We enjoyed our stay, Alex's place is not on the a canal but is great walking distance from lots of great sites in Amsterdam. Perfectly clean, and had the advantage of a fridge as well."
20168,120871044,2016-12-12,1305659,Anna,"Alex made us feel very welcome and answered all our questions and offered to help with anything if we needed assistance.
The location was perfect for discovering Amsterdam on foot. We were close to all kinds of shops and museums etc. The tram stop was immediately outside the door and came by very frequently. We didn't need to use it except on our arrival and departure. About 10 minutes or less from Central Station.
This is a very old house , as described by Alex, so don't let the steep stairs and worn walls of the entrance hall put you off: the room is as shown in the pictures and is quite roomy and comfortable. Lots of heat and hot water provided. The wi-fi was excellent. Though on a busy street it was surprisingly quiet at night and in the mornings. We had a very comfortable sleep in a very comfy bed! We found the fridge a very good asset to us.I could find no fault with the apartment except I would like at least one bright light for reading our travel guide.
As others have said in reviews the high toilet is a little inconvenient but you get used to it. And when you love the convenience of the location and all the other assets outlined above, it doesn't really matter!
Before we travelled to Amsterdam I asked Alex would he consider supplying a kettle and two cups but he graciously declined!It would have been so convenient! But there are numerous cafes round about.
Alex didn't bother us during our stay and was easy when it came to our departure. I would recommend this apartment for a short stay in fabulous Amsterdam and it would be our dream to return and hopefully Alex will host us again!

20168,121463757,2016-12-17,79179866,Hunter,"Very cozy room in a fantastic location. It says private room but it was basically a hotel room; private access, private lock, etc. I would recommend as the perfect place for anyone looking to explore the city of Amsterdam and wants a place to store bags and sleep.

20168,122535145,2016-12-24,30530837,Gavin,"Cosy, clean and romantic room in the heart of Amsterdam city center. A 15 to 20min walk from Amsterdam Central station or just 10min by tram that literally stops in front of the airbnb. 5min from Rembrandt square where there are a dozen of restaurants. Extremely comfortable if you want to spend time in the city center. The house is old and the room is on the 2nd floor. You have to go up a narrow stairs, so it is preferable to come here if you travel light. Bed is great and the area is relatively quiet. The bathroom is cold during the winter and kinda small, but nothing to complain about. The host Alex was friendly and to the point. Discuss with him  regarding the key for when you have to check out."
20168,123027078,2016-12-27,69291872,Kate,Amazing apartment so close to everything in Amsterdam! Nice and clean. Quiet at night. It was just a room which we knew but sometimes it is nice just to have a kettle. Out of our control our plans changed and Alex was very up set about this which made us feel very uncomfortable initially. Lovely stay.
20168,124178551,2017-01-01,19105310,Estelle,"We spent a great time in this room which was clean, comfortable, and just in front of the tram station (very  close to the city center). Alex was welcoming and very reactive when we had a question : it's definitely an experience we could repeat (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
20168,126584175,2017-01-13,86902779,Will,"Very easy and straightforward journey from the airport to the room. We arrived earlier than expected and were greeted by Alex who was very friendly and welcoming. He left us the keys, recommended a place to start our evening and was on his way 5 minutes later to leave us to get on with our trip. The room was clean, warm and the bed very comfortable. Shower had very good water pressure and easy to use. Location was perfect and we were able to walk easily to everywhere we wanted to go. Me and my girlfriend agreed we would definitely stay there again if we ever go back to Amsterdam. Highly recommend to couples looking to stay in the city."

20168,130664420,2017-02-07,1187117,Chelsea,Alex's house was centrally located and perfect to get to know the city during my first few days in Amsterdam. Easy to find and very close to many of the local attractions. 
20168,131017614,2017-02-10,27080229,Robin,"Great place. Thanks for the warm welcome Alex. Alex is very punctual and very helpful with information around the city. The room is spacious and cozy. The place is about 4 tram stops from Centraal station. You can take Tram no.16 which stops right in front of the place. Very easy to find the place. Walking distance to the flower market, dam square and Royal Palace. Enjoyed our stay and hopefully can stay there again in the future."
20168,132175237,2017-02-16,39941388,Mariah,"This private room was as expected. You have to go up a bit of steps to get to the studio, which wasn't a big deal at all, but just a warning if you have a hard time going up stairs or have super heavy luggage. The location is good, pretty close to museums, and to central Amsterdam. I've never experienced an Airbnb that charges for early/late checkout after set times, and that also will charge for baggage hold even after all Airbnb fees are paid. Wasn't too stoked on that as most Airbnb hosts will let you check in early for free and will hold your bags for free as well if possible, but this is noted in the description. So nothing to really complain about. Good location, clean room and clean and private bathroom- but small. We had a nice stay and host was very nice. "

20168,147693131,2017-04-28,111019597,Mark & Cathy,Great location!  5 to 10 minutes by tram from Central Station or enjoy the sights and make the 15 to 20 min walk.  We had a great flat that overlooks the Main Street giving us a great view of the busy city below.  Our private bathroom was clean and efficient. The mini refrigerator was nice and gave us a spot to keep some snacks cold. We felt completely safe and secure our entire stay.  The central location gave us quick access to all of the sights and public transportation that takes you anywhere you want to go quickly.  We found great pubs and restaurants and even a fresh food market within walking distance of our home away from home.  Rembrandt square is just around the corner. Our host was great and did a great job communicating with us before our stay and was completely accessible to us if we needed him during our visit.  This is a nice home base to visit Amsterdam! 
20168,149248246,2017-05-03,111773890,Megan,The location was great but be warned. The bathroom is very small and the room is not as well lit as the pictures show.
20168,152115068,2017-05-15,117587882,Josie,"Perfect location, with a convenient coffee / croissant shop downstairs. The room was bright and sunny. "
20168,155424541,2017-05-28,54339712,Malin,"I am 100% satisfied with my stay here. Looks like the pictures and has everything that was promised. Very comfortable bed, nice bathroom and all the extra that is needed (tv, hairdryer...). 

The location is perfect for someone who want to experience Amsterdam by foot (but also really close to the tram). The road outside I busy but that can't be heard from the room. 

We had breakfast at the café right next to the house. Can be recommended! "
20168,156384750,2017-05-30,83333060,Kelly,Perfect and central! We could walk everywhere and Alex was a lovely and helpful host! 
20168,158010162,2017-06-05,95181456,Leticia,"Alojamiento impecable, genial localización"
20168,158556499,2017-06-07,99909771,Tobias,"Nice, cozy, small and clean apartment placed in the heart of Amsterdam. You can reach the City Centre and everything else within some minutes of walking. However, the price per night seems a little unjustified regarding the size of the apartment. In addition to that, the walls are wafer-thin, hence it is an old house. The house is situated next to a main street which might be very noisy, too. But this depends on the daytime. Nonetheless, the accommodation  is ideal for spending just a couple of nights. Alex, the host, has been very friendly, helpful and answered all our questions. We would recommend this apartment, if you are planning to stay in Amsterdam just for several days."
20168,161206286,2017-06-17,90453950,Lingjun,"The room is very comfortable and private. Me and my mother are glad to stay in Alex's place, because he is so nice and willing to help us cope with issues. 

It's good to live in central place, which means you can walk to any tourist attractions conveniently. Actually, Alex place just locates in the central line of Amsterdam, between the central station and Amsterdam national museum. 
"
20168,164858317,2017-06-29,65193354,Anna,The room is perfect for couples who want something within walking distance to Amsterdam's biggest attractions. It was clean and the bed was comfy. 
20168,165209482,2017-06-30,1824988,Lisa,Clean & comfortable. Alex was prompt with all communication so my experience with his accommodations were seamless. The room might be smaller than what you expect from looking at the pictures but it was plenty for what we needed. The only suggestion I have is to furnish the room with a full length mirror l or place the wall mirror lower. Some of us travelers are shorter than the native Dutch ;)
20168,166618423,2017-07-04,14435230,Chelsea,"The stay here was great. Me and my boyfriend have visited Amsterdam a number of times but this was our first airbnb. Please remember to bring your own towels and loo paper if you're staying for a while, these weren't replaced or replenished. Apart from that, everything was as expected. The location is great so it can be a bit busy at night. The downside to this was there was a man who claimed he knew Alexander and tried to enter our Room every night. Clearly intoxicated but luckily my boyfriend knows jujitsu and was able to fight him off night after night. 

Apart from that, 5 stars Alex. Great stay"
20168,167318657,2017-07-06,28163088,John,"The location is GREAT! And the room was beautiful. I loved the wall of windows, and the old beam ceiling. It was decorated beautifully. "

20168,169867698,2017-07-14,326327,Juve,Very central location. Alex was easy to communicate with. Getting from the airport to the studio was a bit of a challenge and a walk especially if you have luggage. The stairs are super narrow which is challenging when carrying luggage. Very central location and close to all the fun and beauty of Amsterdam but the room was quiet and very comfortable. Wifi was a bit spotty but I would stay here again. Thank you Alex!
20168,175995420,2017-07-30,27530459,Victoria,"This flat is in easy walking distance of the city's main attractions. There were lots of great restaurants / bars very close by. The room was well presented and clean, although it is situated on a busy road. We slept well with the windows shut as it blocked out the noise, but might not be so ideal for someone looking for a peaceful, tranquil location."
20168,179308229,2017-08-07,97361161,Scott,"Great place to stay in a central location. Alex was great at communicating and setting up a check in time. Room is big and clean
Wifi was a bit unreliable at times as there were multiple options to connect to. 
Close to great nightlife. 20min walk from Centraal station and close to the trams. 
Thanks Alex!!"

The room is spacious, sunny, and just perfect, the bathroom could be slightly bigger!

Alex was very welcoming and responsive!

Amsterdam is simply amazing!!"
20168,200113737,2017-10-04,147226181,Chrys,Perfect location. City center is very close to Alex's place. It's like a hotel room.
20168,204017023,2017-10-16,72703412,Pearle,Location was easy to find and accommodation is clean. Overall a good stay! Thank you for hosting us!
20168,210428021,2017-11-09,153769759,Jean,"Alex's place is in a great location, close to many sights such as Rembrandt Square. There is also a tram stop really close by. Very convenient for exploring other areas of the city.  The building itself is quite old. You'll need to climb two flights of stairs to get to the room, which is a little dark. I would suggest putting brighter lights, as it makes for easier packing and unpacking. The wifi signal was weak and spotty at times, so it's not great if you are heavily reliant on wifi. The building is made of wood and quite old, so sometimes you can hear feel vibrations when neighbours slam their doors (so make sure you don't slam yours). Unfortunately, that's just part of staying in an old wooden apartment. The bathroom is a bit tight, and you will be instructed to leave the little window open, as there are no ventilators installed. As there's no heater in the bathroom, the bathroom will be very cold, if the weather is cold. Get ready to sit on a cold toilet seat, which also happens to be unusually high. Fortunately the shower doors help to keep the heat in while showering. If you stay here, watch out for the knobs that stick out of the bed rails. We jammed our hips into it several times, as the space between the bed and the wall and windows is quite narrow, and the room is dark. Also, there is no hot water boiler/electric kettle in the room (due to an incident with a previous guest, we were told), so you won't be able to make coffee or tea. Fortunately there are some really nice cafes and bakeries (go to 
 C'est Magnifique at Leidsestraat 18) below and nearby. If not for the above-mentioned points, I would rate this room 5 stars, as the location is really good."
20168,212150092,2017-11-16,106158998,Jessica,"¡Hola!
Si buscas una cama cómoda y además que el apartamento este bien ubicado, sin duda te recomiendo hospedarte aquí. Alex te entrega ls llaves de tu habitación y del edificio por lo que tus entradas y salidas son independientes, a demás de que fue puntual en hacerlo. En lo personal la habitación me encanto, no te llevas descripción alguna si lo comparas con la imagen."
20168,216514590,2017-12-04,57723283,John,"About a week before we were due to arrive in Amsterdam we received three or four messages from the host concerning our check-in time. We had received others before this, however they appeared as automatic messages, and did not respond(This was our mistake, of course). A few on this occasion appeared to be automatic messages, however there were a few more after which were quite panicked and regarded our expected check-in time. Alex said that he had planned a trip to Germany and that he wouldn't be able to check us in and that we would have to pay a 25€ service charge for somebody else to wait and check us in. It was still a week before we were due to arrive, and we did not feel we needed to provide a check-in time this soon. While it is not Alex's fault that we did not respond to his messages initially, we found his responses quite blunt, and had a lot of emphasis on how the situation ""was not his fault"". At no point did we blame him for the situation, and we paid the charge for our check-in, which was within the times provided on his page, as he had to get somebody to wait for us.

The accomodation and ammenities were all up to standard, and it appears from his reviews that Alex is a nice guy and a thoughtful host. Perhaps we caught him at a bad time, but we felt his communication with us was quite rude and unnecessarily panicked. 

Thank you for providing us with your home Alex."
20168,217698020,2017-12-10,9483238,Renata,Really perfect place in city centre. Clean and nice room but a little cold. Alex was kind and helpful. We recommend this place.
20168,218695630,2017-12-14,152720104,Emily,"Perfect simple space to be able to come back to after exploring the city all day. It is easy to walk to most parts of the city from here but is also in a quiet are so got a great night sleep (in an extremely comfy bed!). Also a good value for money for 2 poor students, so was able to leave us with some more cash to explore the city. Alex was a fantastic host. Would highly recommend."
20168,218846369,2017-12-15,4996480,J.P.,"Alex’s apartment was in a great location and is highly walkable, however our stay was not ideal. In a role where customer service and cultural competency matter a great deal, my wife and I found Alex to be demanding (he changed our check-in time without discussion or appreciation) and rude (I understand the Dutch can be direct in their communication, however the first thing Alex did was insult and offend us). As someone who deeply values the human interaction element of Airbnb, and with so many options in Amsterdam, I would not stay here again."
20168,220226456,2017-12-21,28319348,Abdul,"Amazing location in the heart of the city. Nice decor. Alex was very down-to-business about the Airbnb, but respectful. We had some issues with the WiFi and the Fridge. 

Will recommend mostly for the location."
20168,220915949,2017-12-24,129747565,Daisy,"Central but quiet as it is slightly away from bars and clubs. Really great location, loads of cafes and restaurants nearby. Room was good - bathroom was cold at times as we had to leave the window open. Bed was really big and really comfy after a long day. Lovely to stay for a weekend "
20168,221614213,2017-12-27,46176918,Lesley,"The room was clean and cosy and very centrally located. I wasn't expecting to have a fridge, so it was a nice surprise. We were able to come and go as we needed and didn't feel like we were imposing. It was a lovely stay right in the middle of what I assumed would be a very busy time of year. Christmas in Amsterdam is just beautiful."
20168,222642142,2017-12-30,149962840,Sue,"The room is perfectly located for exploring Amsterdam and has the added benefit of a coffee shop underneath it, wonderful for your early morning cup of tea.
The room is stylish and spotlessly clean and the bed is so comfortable you have to force yourself out in the morning!
Thank you Alex for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home."
20168,225125183,2018-01-05,43126108,Weverton,"Very Nice place to take some days in Amsterdam, very close to some museums and the life in the city."
20168,229367413,2018-01-23,164122165,Ines,Good place! A bit cold in the night didn't expect that and the bathroom is very small. But generally the location is AMAZING!! And it's perfect for 1/2 nights stay
20168,229894808,2018-01-26,39069517,Chloé,"Super logement, propreté et état impeccable. Emplacement parfait. Je recommande sans hésitations."
20168,231424249,2018-02-01,36959936,Anika,"Great place, right downtown, very spacious. Thanks Alex! :)"
20168,243025476,2018-03-14,22443678,Erik,Super central Studio. Had a supernice stay.
20168,248772393,2018-04-01,26070985,Danielle,Alex met us at 2pm for check in and gave us some tips and guides for our time in Amsterdam! The apartment is in a great location and was perfect for a few days stay. The bed was SO comfy!! Would stay here again - thank you Alex!
20168,251668920,2018-04-08,77059155,David,"Alex's place is in a great location for those who have never been to Amsterdam before. It is a short walk to any of the local tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.  The room was clean although quite small and simple but that was perfect for us who were not planning on staying in the room for very long other than sleeping and washing.  Only draw back was only one window opened slightly which made the room a bit stuffy at night. All in all a good stay though. Definetily recommend for those wanting to stay in a central location."
20168,255999699,2018-04-22,56104003,Barb,"Great location. Alex was a good host,even bringing us a fan for an unusually warm April stay."
20168,260594564,2018-05-04,104398092,Lyuba,"The location was very nice and walking distance to everything we needed. The room was clean and big, note that the building is older and doesn’t have an elevator."
20168,262201322,2018-05-08,80948477,Aliki,"Πολυ ωραιος χωρος, ο οικοδεσποτης ευγενεστατος. Το προτεινω ανεπιφυλακτα!"
20168,266447591,2018-05-20,26289366,Martin,"Clean and very nice location. Definitely value for money!!
Only downside is the fact that you can hear every footsteps of the guests above very loud, and it seemed like our upstairs neighbors walked around a lot with shoes on."
20168,267172296,2018-05-21,24012759,Alex,"Nice place, calm and comfortable."
20168,269233100,2018-05-27,14852694,Viktor,Everything was perfect!
20168,272315844,2018-06-03,62964644,Grace,"We enjoyed our stay with Alex and loved the location. It was very easy to get around the city by walking or taking public transportation. 

The building is very old and so our room was very hot for it being end of May/beginning of June. Our host offered us a 2nd fan which helped but the windows can’t be opened very much so it is very hard to get the room ventilated. Also, the WiFi was a bit unreliable. "
20168,276250906,2018-06-13,9364897,Catherine,Clean stylish room close to everything. Thank you
20168,277411769,2018-06-16,183515433,Francesca,"Le foto della Camera rispecchiano esattamente la realtà. Camera molto pulita, confortevole e vicina al centro. Alex (host) è stato disponibile sin da subito ed è molto gentile. La consiglio assolutamente, é stata una bellissima vacanza"

20168,282436304,2018-06-27,19236879,Maximiliano,The apartment of Alex is very nice and the perfect choice to enjoy Amsterdam. It’s near everything! We re happy we spent our days there.

20168,287344274,2018-07-08,32866950,Emily,"Thank you for being so accommodating, communication with yourself was so easy! The area was perfect for us not to close but no so far 10 min walk from city centre loved it! We would revisit most definetly"
20168,295831260,2018-07-24,43709740,Reena,Alex has a nice little apartment within walking distance of all the sights of Amsterdam.  Alex was very hospitable and gave tips of what to see on our trip.
20168,296111795,2018-07-25,186860182,Rebekka,"Perfect! In the center of the city with nice stores in the neighbourhood. Easy Check-in, very clean and comfortable room!"
20168,297770888,2018-07-28,68893445,Karla,Right in the city center. Clean space with a comfy bed and private bathroom (with small shower). Alex was very friendly and provided suggestions about things to do in the city. Overall great experience.
20168,301454074,2018-08-04,8305702,David,Great location   
20168,303427342,2018-08-07,95766322,Mila,"Alex’s place is perfect! Location is great and perfect size for just 2 of you. He was very helpful if we needed anything and always contactable. 
Only problem we had was the place was extremely warm as there is no aircon and only one window slightly opens. Also the wifi connection is very poor."
20168,310309658,2018-08-19,77515468,Pierre,"Chambre très sympa, très propre et merveilleusement bien placée.
Merci alex "

20168,316312942,2018-08-31,158580985,Margaux,"Amazing location, walking distance from all major attractions. The space was very clean and Alex is very accommodating and quick to respond to messages "
20168,321869916,2018-09-11,193864981,Meagan,The location is probably the best part. Alex’s place is very clean and quiet. Great place to refuel so you can see the city!
20168,325622541,2018-09-20,11677714,Daria,Everything is ok! Slow wi-fi.
20168,334008181,2018-10-08,162654532,Haley,"Good location, had a bad check in experience since he was not responding."
20168,335078499,2018-10-11,78850244,Rosy,"Desde los mensajes que te manda es grosero y poco profesional, por tal razón, no quisimos ni siquiera llegar a su hospedaje, le dije que haría check in y a qué hora  y no me respondió, así que asumí que no me esperaría porque ya me había amenazado que si no le contestaba pronto no me quería ver en su casa!! Así tal cuál con esas palabras, por eso me puse a ver sus evaluaciones y me di cuenta que ya había tratado a más personas así que , por lo tanto no llegamos. El trato debe ser cordial desde un principio y el no lo es así que no lo recomiendo en lo absoluto."
20168,342043344,2018-10-28,218625415,Claire,Perfect place in Amsterdam. Felt like home. Very clean. Quiet.
20168,342649497,2018-10-29,31135762,Ashley,"Alex's place has very good location - close to the Dam and central station, and has many restaurants and shops within 10min walking distance. Closest tram station is 200m away.  The room is very clean, good value and highly recommended!"
20168,343643028,2018-11-01,65610109,Kirsty,We left booking our accommodation a bit late so weren't really sure what to expect when we arrived but we couldn't have been more pleased when we arrived! Perfect location within easy reach of all of the main tourist attractions. Lovely comfy bed and blackout curtains which helped block out some of the noise from the road (which wasn't particularly loud even when the curtains were open) Would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Amsterdam.
20168,344757041,2018-11-04,37506766,Lavinia,"I had a very nice trip to Amsterdam. The room was clean and like in the pictures. Those big windows in the morning are an amazing boost for the day. The house is very well placed. You are basically near everything you have to visit in Amsterdam. We didn't used any tram, we walked and it was very cool. I recommend this place and if I will come back I guess I will come back to Alexander."
20168,345546131,2018-11-05,24531900,Alex,I had a nice stay here. The location was good and the place was super clean. I’d stay here again.
20168,346113600,2018-11-07,3450231,Xenia,"The stay at Alex' apartment has been very nice. The flat is very well located and you walk to the centre in under 5-10 minutes. The bed is insanely comfortable. Just the bathroom is a little tiny, but that was no big issue. 
We can recommend the place very much if you want to stay for a short trip :)"
20168,347920136,2018-11-12,218812712,Antoni,"Très agréable et super emplacement. 
Je le recommande fortement."
20168,351914553,2018-11-24,195378607,Yamila,"Me hospede en el piso de Alex. 
Es muy hermoso y la ubicación es buena, pero lo que realmente me hizo pasar mal y dudar en el momento de si perder mi dinero e irme a un hotel o quedarme allí fue el trato con Alex. Desde el momento 1 fue bastante rudo con los mensajes solo porque yo estaba trabajando y no los podía leer. Le expliqué y ya me había molestado bastante su forma de hablarme. 
Luego tuve otro problema cuando llegue a amsterdam, habíamos arreglado que me iría a buscar y me llevaría a la casa. Llegue y Alex esperaba que yo pudiera llegar sola a una terminal de salidas siendo que iba por primera vez a amsterdam, no tengo porque conocer el aeropuerto y además algo obvio. LLEGAMOS EN ARRIBOS Y SALIDAS ESTA AL OTRO LADO DEL AEROPUERTO. la comunicación fue malísima y el no nos habló nada bien. Es bastante grosero. Realmente me saco de quicio la situación y me tomé un uber porque era muy complicado. 
La casa es hermosa, pero no se si vale la pena, el trato es muy importante y es la primera impresión."
20168,353272872,2018-11-27,168761978,Perry,Overall decent
20168,353942448,2018-11-30,42302394,Thalia,"Alex's room is in a great location and is really good value for money (if you don't check in early/late)! 


The room had all the basics and was in such a fantastic location, especially given the reasonable price. The bed was comfortable and we had all the basics we needed. We only stayed for one night and it was perfect for us for one night. If you wanted to stay longer, it may be worth noting that the bathroom is pretty small and there are no tea making facilities/only plastic cups for drinking water from the bathroom tap. 

My main negative was that, as soon as we booked, we received an email with a list of extra costs for early/late check in (€25/35!), baggage storage etc. and it came across incredibly unfriendly and gave me the impression that the host was going to try to find any excuse to charge me extra. But everything was fine and we didn't pay anything extra. 

Overall, the room was perfect for us for a one night stay and really good value. Thanks!"
20168,355722087,2018-12-05,63541458,Devan,Great apartment in a central location. We were able to walk everywhere and everything was in a 10-15 minute radius. Small apartment but cute and worth it for your trip to Amsterdam.
20168,355877198,2018-12-06,51983517,Anna,Alex was very prompt with our check in and check out! Everything was clean and in order. Great location for seeing the city!
20168,357437887,2018-12-10,78117593,Kenan,"Very clean and cosy apartment with a central location! The room is well equipped and has a nice view on the busy street, but nevertheless it is very quiet inside. The bathroom is really small, but very clean and modern!"
20168,357904868,2018-12-12,56035492,Fernando,"I wouldn't stay here again unless there was literally no other option, or that I didn't have enough time to book elsewhere.

The apartment is VERY NICELY located, with a Grocery store less than 5 minutes away.. and a very comfortable bed. That's all the good things I have to mention.

Wi-Fi did not work ANY of the days we stayed there, not even the ""other"" networks they recommended us to connect to, in practicality we were OFFLINE while here.

The apartment building is more like a poorly renovated area, with a poorly built, MINUSCULE staircase, no elevator (which we knew), and literally dirty, messed up drywall that hasn't been cleaned since construction.

This is nothing more than a bed in a room with a door.. there's no love in this apartment, there's nothing worth writing about in it, it's literally barebones minimalism, in a good location."
20168,361726944,2018-12-24,59824637,Jose Manuel,Nice room
20168,368123312,2019-01-06,22096128,Flash,"Alexander had a nice room in an amazing location to sight see. It was a little noisy at night, as you can hear every movement of the person staying above you. Also we couldn’t get the tv and the internet to work. We weren’t in the room much though, so that wasn’t a major issue for us. The bed was comfortable, and the room was nice overall. We would stay again."
20168,368876324,2019-01-08,61575769,Vanessa,"Alexander’s place was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. Not only was the room very clean and conveniently located, but when issues arose, Alexander helped us to find a solution quickly and efficiently. Thanks again for a wonderful stay!"

20168,403008396,2019-01-20,207500396,Emma,Lovely room in a perfect location for a long weekend in Amsterdam. We were able to walk everywhere which was great. The room was cosy and the bed was lovely and big.
20168,406100320,2019-01-28,2603173,Thomas,The apartment is in an amazing location and all you need for a short break away.
20168,406340641,2019-01-29,185222312,Ryan,Fantastic Location for Amsterdam Central! Clean and tidy perfect for a night or 2.
20168,406917912,2019-01-31,48630838,Mark,Good place for a weekend trip. Alexanders friend was helpful for setting everything up.
20168,408959036,2019-02-06,163899365,Tai Kwan,"Very bad experience.

He glued the chewing gum on the pillow, And Alexander Always Late Reply, And He said he need to work, will give us the key very late when we’re coming.
This guy is a joke, Do not try to Sleep here."
20168,411379119,2019-02-12,81292184,Suad,Cute little place perfectly located in the center. Wish we stayed longer.

20168,418519744,2019-03-02,176954022,Pono,"We had a nice stay at Alexander’s studio.  Studio was clean and in a prime location. Just a few notes before booking. The steps leading to the studio are very steep
And tight. The studio is a lot smaller than I anticipated but good enough for me and my girlfriend. The bathroom also is very small and toilet is high off the ground."
20168,419902017,2019-03-05,60112309,Kelsey,Great location and great host.
20168,421321034,2019-03-09,1979076,Kellene,The location was great! In a nice part of town that seemed pretty easy to find everything. The area is pretty quiet at night and the neighborhood seemed safe. there's a coffee shop below that has great croissants. The wifi access was a little poor and we struggled with that. Overall a great experience.
20168,422490117,2019-03-11,216212563,Josh,"Lovely modern room in an ideal location, within walking distance of all the attractions. Perfect for couples"
20168,423169117,2019-03-13,92730436,Brian,"This place has an amazing location. Walking distance from every where you would want to visit in Amsterdam. Very basic, small studio apartment.   Poor WiFi signal, be prepared to use cell if necessary.  Also TV reception was bad so if you hang out there at all, make sure you have some sort of entertainment.  The host tries to hit you up to pay extra for amenities but just say no. Toilet is oddly high off the ground, and if you visit during the winter the bathroom will be cold."
20168,424758048,2019-03-17,72779786,Lars Alexander,All was as described. Would recommend for anyone who just needs a private room with own entrance and the best location in Amsterdam
20168,425909311,2019-03-19,54970592,Ahmed,"The room is placed nicely in the centre of Amsterdam within walking distance from a lot of place but even better, a tram goes right outside. Alexander is a great host warming us to the city as we checked in. Thank you for hosting us, looking forward to next time!"
20168,426479138,2019-03-21,17148565,Andy,"If you have the option, stay with Alexander. The place is close to everything, quiet and clean. We we're able to get everywhere very easily. There is a cafe downstairs to get your morning espresso as well! Very convenient! The bed was super comfortable and we slept amazingly!"

20168,452949504,2019-05-14,68311923,Jackie,We enjoyed our stay here—it had all that we needed to spend a few days in Amsterdam! The location was convenient and close to everything we wanted to see in the city. Alexander was easy to communicate with as well.
20168,462787731,2019-06-02,5455931,Benjamin,"La chambre privée était conforme à ce qui est noté dans l’annonce. Super emplacement à deux pas de la place Rembrandt et très propre. Il y a un café juste en bas de la porte d’entrée dans lequel nous avons pris tous nos petits déjeuners et cafés ils sont très bien! Alexander a été un hôte très réactif, disponible et de bons conseils! Je recommande cet endroit qui est parfait pour passer quelques jours à Amsterdam car nous pouvons tout faire à pied (et le tram est juste en face de l’appartement)."
20168,464215580,2019-06-05,80989702,Katie,Very good location!

20168,476429835,2019-06-26,195160776,Damian,"Would 100% recommend! Alexander was so kind and helpful, let us check in early, provided a 24 hour number to contact him if we had any trouble and provided us with everything we needed. He even recommended the best way to travel to the apartment so we’d save money. It’s in a great location close the everything and we really felt at home. A fantastic host and would stay again"
20168,477005457,2019-06-27,94844595,María Gabriel,"The location is beyond amazing, you are near the center of the city and  affordable restaurants are close. The space is comfortable and it has a really nice style."
20168,478568948,2019-06-30,115364567,Renata,"O quarto é muito bom, espaçoso , bem localizado, limpo. Fizemos muitos programas a pé.  O banheiro é pequenininho mas não atrapalhou em nada. Em baixo do prédio tem um coffe que serve cafe da manha que eh bem gostoso. Alexander era muito rápido nas respostas, nos permitiu fazer late check in por um valor a mais e tb nos deixou deixar as malas la por 1 hora a mais do check in sem cobrar nada. Para chegar no quarto tem umas escadas e quem tiver mala pesada se prepare seria único incomodo, mas que não atrapalhou, pois Alexander prontamente nos ajudou."
20168,479682550,2019-07-01,950813,Julie,"We had a short 1 night stay at Alexander's, the location was great for us. He was there to greet us upon arrival which was easy as he responded to messages fast. The place is clean, small shower but a really good pressure and temperature, and yes a high toilet but thoughtful to have a stool for easy access and to view the mirror. The room was warm at night because we had to close the windows (to block the sound outside) but there's a fan for ventilation. Overall a nice place with a convenient location. Recommended if you need a short stay in Amsterdam!"
20168,481668665,2019-07-05,250087294,William,"Great location, right in the heart of the city. Amazing soundproof windows and great communication with Alexander! Thank you!"
20168,483972568,2019-07-08,16500546,Sophie,"Fourth time in Amsterdam and by far the best location and value for money accommodation we have stayed in. So close to absolutely everything but still quiet enough that you get a good nights sleep. Check in and out was really easy. The place is perfect if you just want a ‘stop and go’, we never need a kitchen because of all the amazing places to eat nearby. WiFi was super quick and the room was lovely and clean. Thanks again, will be back!"
20168,489670950,2019-07-17,34698270,Miya,"The apartment is in a safe location. Extremely close to all of the attractions around Amsterdam. If you’re a walker there’s not need for public transportation! We walked the entire city and it was fine. The house is under minor renovation in the hallways. The room is perfect for 2-4 days. There is a refrigerator, desk, and bed. The room is bigger than I expected and the bathroom is clean. Just a stand up shower, toilet, and sink. Check in easy, make sure to just press the doorbell."

20168,495542891,2019-07-26,36656352,Mateuse,Alexander's place was in an absolutely fantastic location in Amsterdam! All big sights and main walking tours were within walking distance and it was close to central station.  It was located in a nice area and all facilities were as described. We were in Amsterdam during 37 degree Celsius heat so it did get a bit hot (no airconditioning). However this temperature was very out of the ordinary and we were provided with a fan for air circulation.
20168,508037916,2019-08-12,249009550,David,We had a great stay at Alexander's place. It was very clean and in a perfect location. Literally 12 minute walk to all the main attractions. Couldn't fault anything and we will definitely be back.
20168,509300331,2019-08-14,39925880,Chris,"My partner and I had a SUPER stay at Alexander’s studio flat. It has all you need, is spotlessly clean and is a great location, being on Tram route 24 direct to the Central Train Station and being close to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. There is a bagel shop underneath the flat, so breakfast/brunch is easy!

Enjoy!
We did.
Chris and Helen"
20168,512206124,2019-08-18,197491051,Friedrich Alexander,Nice and cozy appartment. The only negative thing was that the walls are very thin. Next to the appatment was a construction site and it felt like they were working in our room. However the adresse of the flat is very good and every major sight was in walking distance.
20168,513275629,2019-08-19,155279818,Arnon Juan,Quarto com ótima localização e muito agradável.
20168,519377788,2019-08-28,120695015,Chris,"Amazing location, everything we needed was walking distance. It got very warm at night and no air conditioning and there was construction outside, but this is no fault to Alexander. Think it would suit better for short breaks!"

20168,539888563,2019-10-02,181664098,Shaylin,"Really nice place, just the right size for my solo trip. It seems that they might be doing some work in the shop down below but you wouldn’t notice it after 2200. Really great location too!"
20168,543165149,2019-10-07,208502966,Anj,"A really lovely room, thank you Alexander for the quick responses."

20168,553463822,2019-10-24,114154804,Fionn,"We had a lovely stay in Alexander’s place!  It’s in the perfect location, an equally short walk from both the museums and the city centre, with plenty of cafes nearby. The space itself is small, but comfortable, private, clean and has everything you’ll need for a short stay. Check-in and check-out were incredibly convenient, and we were even able to check-in early. Overall, we highly rate our stay here, the only recommendation I can make is to have some amenities in the room to make tea and coffee."
20168,553873777,2019-10-25,17765486,Pauline,"Emplacement parfait .
Propre."
20168,555800465,2019-10-28,107788098,Liza,"I booked Alexander’s air b n b as a birthday treat for my boyfriend and it didn’t let us down! It was located within walking distance of everything we needed, right next to the canals and a short walk to the station. The room it’s self was spacious and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side but perfect for what we needed for a few nights. I would definitely recommend staying here. Alexander is very flexible and allowed us to check in late as our flight was a late one."
20168,556294148,2019-10-29,19239842,Kristin,This was a great place to stay. Location was within walking distance to everything and it was clean and comfortable!

20168,571442850,2019-12-01,6003317,Alvaro,"Inmejorable ubicación. Situado en el centro de Amsterdam a pocos pasos de todo lo imprescindible que visitar. Habitación amplia y limpia. Alexander muy atento, a pesar de que nos equivocamos al decirle la hora de llegada, se acerco a darnos las llaves 2 horas antes de lo estimado."
20168,573139318,2019-12-05,203087005,Iris,"We're absolutely amazed with this experience. Highly recommend! 
Thanks Alexander for your kindness and your tips about the city as well!"
25428,228847675,2018-01-21,43336597,Andrew,"The apartment was spacious clean and perfectly located for transport, cafes, facilities and tourist sights. The apartment had great views and it had a fully serviced kitchen which was suitable for cooking meals.
It had a lift which is a huge plus in Amsterdam.
The check in and check out was very easy, friendly and efficient. We were met at the agreed time. I would fully recommend the apartment and would visit there again when we next go to Amsterdam."
25428,412767296,2019-02-16,12054117,Janet,A large sunny apartment in a great location with all amenities including an elevator up a few steps.  The tram is right outside and the supermarket is steps away. Jordan is a interesting neighborhood on its own and it's close to the museum's and other sights.
25428,451151096,2019-05-11,25016326,Andrew,"Joan's place in Amsterdam is awesome! It's conveniently located in a sort of central location within Amsterdam without being TOO close to the tourist hot spots. Everything in the apartment exceeded my expectations -- the living room is nice and spacious, and the bed is very comfortable as well. For future guests, make sure to rent a bike for a couple days during your stay to experience the bike culture of Amsterdam :)"
27886,851027,2012-01-09,1008593,Wayne,"Excellent accommodation, close to everything, lovely hosts, beautiful breakfasts, a unique place to stay in beautiful Amsterdam "
27886,2359368,2012-09-21,128124,Chuck,"What can I say, Flip provided the perfect Amsterdam experience for us and did so on a beautiful boat. It's located on the water near the city center. He provides bikes and a canoe (although we didn't have a chance to use that). 

Breakfast is left each morning in your cabin and is the nicest European breakfast I've had to date. Wonderful breads, meats, cheese and jams. 

The space is surrounded by water and is in a very safe neighborhood. We walked all over the city quite easily. 

I can't thank Flip enough for being the perfect host. Thanks for making our trip so wonderful!"
27886,3564846,2013-02-17,1577154,Alessandro,"Ottima accoglienza, un soggiorno da ripetere. Flip cura molto il servizio che offre, la colazione è abbondante e molto variata. le bici che include nel prezzo sono comodissime per visitare la città. molto positiva tutta l'esperienza. attenzione al parcheggio, se siete in auto, 24 h costano 40 euro come nel resto del centro città..."
27886,7509410,2013-09-23,2580046,Leigh,Just a superb way to spend time in Amsterdam. A very well constructed space within this boat creates a very comfortable environment. Very close to town and central station and a very comfortable bed. Just when you think things can't get any better Flip turns up with a breakfast that wows. Flip is all very helpful and interesting. Highly recommended. The bikes are the icing on the cake. Also Flip has a little hidden gem of a restaurant to point you to.
27886,18429729,2014-08-26,19274667,Alicia,"Perfect from start to finish! Flip went above and beyond in every aspect, right down to the perfectly cooked eggs for breakfast :) A+ for a unique experience in a wonderful city"
27886,21170224,2014-10-12,22059777,Pernille,"Why stay anywhere else in the city of canals when you can stay on a house boat? This is absolutely an unique way to spend time in Amsterdam. Beautiful boat very close to the central station, comfortable space,  great breakfast and the bikes completed the experience. "
27886,21482204,2014-10-18,22031742,Guanita,"Wij hebben een geweldige tijd gehad op de woonboot van Flip. Bij aankomst lagen er fortune  cookies op de kussens van het bed en op dat moment waren we verkocht. Heerlijke plek alles lekker schoon en fris en fantastisch centraal gelegen. 's Morgens werd er een heerlijk ontbijt geserveerd die met liefde gemaakt was. We mochten ook nog eens gebruik maken van de fietsen. Fietsend door Amsterdam was een fantastische beleving. Bedankt voor het delen van deze bijzondere plek en wij kijken ernaar uit om in de toekomst een keer terug te komen.. Groetjes, Guanita & Marcel"
27886,21700505,2014-10-22,1903600,Lin,"The place was beautiful and bright, even when it was cloudy out. In the evenings, it was warm and cozy. Great location for really experiencing Amsterdam. The neighborhood felt very safe. 

The WiFi was fast. Check-in was very easy and we were able to check in earlier than many other AirBnBs will accommodate, which was helpful for our travel schedule.

The breakfast was as amazing as everyone says. A lot of variety for a catered breakfast."
27886,21848508,2014-10-25,8884815,Tawny,"Flip's houseboat is very cool. It is tastefully designed, comfortable and quiet. What a unique way to experience Amsterdam! We especially enjoyed using the canoe to explore the canals. Flip is an accommodating and friendly host, and he serves a lovely breakfast. We have nothing but positive things to say about our experience."
27886,23167601,2014-11-24,22527810,Ludovic,"L'endroit est tout simplement génial. Le cadre est calme et reposant. La vue donne simplement l'impression de s'évader. Bref, c'est le lieu idéal pour un séjour à Amsterdam.

Pour se déplacer, les vélos sont fournis, on retrouve 2 stations de bus (bus 48 en direction de Centruum) à 5min à peine. 

La péniche est bien agencée, le petit-déjeuner est délicieux et Flip est  super cool. Il est prévenant et à l'écoute. Vous ne serez pas déçu du détour.

A prendre sans hésiter !"

27886,30548926,2015-04-24,11348501,Chris,Amazing place to stay. Flip was a great host and his breakfasts were perfect before heading out. The location was just far enough away to get away from the craziness and close enough to enjoy everything AMS has to offer. We would return without a second thought!
27886,34691248,2015-06-11,26277787,Kortney,"This was a great houseboat. Location is a bit off the beaten path- in a good way. No tour boats flying by at all hours, peaceful, beautiful. Great breakfast in the morning. Very quaint quarters but my 6'3"" husband didn't mind and said it was well worth it. Bikes included was a huge bonus. Less than 5 minute bike ride to some great restaurants, cafes, and shops. Would recommend to friends! "
27886,36669190,2015-06-30,2917184,Andrey,"Amazing! The location is great: close to centre but quiet. Delicious breakfast: fresh juice, coffee, croissants, eggs and etc. Mmmmm. 
Design of boat is another thing that you will like. All things are stylish and cute. 
Thank you, Flip! "
27886,37983129,2015-07-12,34125009,Jim,"We loved or stay on the canel boat!  Flip was welcomingand helpful with suggestions for eating.  Quiet part of amsterdam.  The space was lovely and we enjoyed breakfast outdoors on dock in the morning.  Flip brought over wonderful basket of bread, cheese, sauage, and eggs every morning.  Bed was so comfortable.  Highly recommend."
27886,44043341,2015-08-23,41492311,Andrés,"We felt very welcomed right from the very beginning in this wonderful place. Cozy and very well kept, Flip made us feel like being at home. 

The attention to detail and interior design makes MS Luctor an unique houseboat experience.

Breakfast from the wonderful breakfast basket by the canal is definitively a must, no better place than MS Luctor.

We will definitively be back"
27886,51315747,2015-10-19,42127033,Amanda,"Such a wonderful experience! Flip was a very welcoming host. He is easy to talk to and full of great tips and suggestions. The houseboat is lovely and cozy. The breakfast that Flip brought us every morning was the cherry on top. He also provided us with bikes, which truly is the best way to see Amsterdam. It was a great experience staying here! The location is great. Quiet but not far from the city centre. Very close to the artsy area of Amsterdam! Definitely recommend staying here. You will not regret it! "
27886,51780585,2015-10-24,7065261,Cindy,Super dagen gehad. Boot en fietsen top. Ontbijt Super en eten aan de overkant bij de Gouden Reael een aanrader.

Flip is a lovely host! My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 days and we really felt at home!
The boat has so many lovely little details and the breakfast is really good and was always a perfect start into the day.
The boat is not to far away from the city. We mainly walked without any problems. 

Thanks Flip!"
27886,54089799,2015-11-16,13821443,Juliette,"Peniche hyper confort, chaleureuse, bien équipée ( et bien chauffée).

A conseiller!"

The breakfast was really extravagant and delicious: cheese, ham, croissants, cereal and boiled eggs. 

Located right around the corner from a great supermarket and lots of lovely restaurants."

Les vélos prêtés par Flip sont en bon état et c'est un excellent moyen de visiter Amsterdam. Le petit-déjeuner est délicieux avec des bons produits.

27886,62743088,2016-02-16,8394917,Vincent Jet,"Flip was a fantastic host. Very friendly and welcoming. Very attentive but also gave you space to make it a most excellent stay. Breakfast was fantastic full of lovely treats. Location is spot on. 5 minutes to walk to everything you need. Close enough to be for you to walk it, far away enough to feel like your'e not still in a tourist area. A super relaxing environment, will recommend to friends and we look forward to attending again.

The breakfast is amazing and the houseboat is really cute.
The silence ok the docks in the morning when you have breakfast in me. Luctor is really precious.

27886,64602745,2016-03-06,18479013,Kirstin Und Michael,"Wir haben unsere Flittertage auf diesem wundervollen Hausboot verbracht und waren mehr als begeistert! Die Unterkunft ist genau wie beschrieben, alles sehr sauber und ganz besonders liebevoll eingerichtet-einfach toll! Ein besonderes Highlight ist sicherlich das Frühstück, welches man mit einem herrlichen Blick auf die Gracht genießen kann. Flip ist unglaublich freundlich und die eigens zusammengestellte Mappe mit allen wichtigen Informationen zu Ausflugszielen, Märkten, Restaurants usw. ist eine tolle Hilfe! Alles in allem hätte unser Aufenthalt nicht schöner sein können und wir freuen uns darauf wiederzukommen!"

27886,68319066,2016-04-04,37825537,Thomas,"This is a beautiful, charming boat located in the very peaceful Westerdok. The surrounding area is beautiful, with a city farm and historic craft beer bar within 2 mins walk (try the Oud Kase at Westerdok bar - it comes on a guillotine!) The breakfast provided by Flip was more than enough to make sandwiches for lunch too, and he thoughtfully catered to our dietary needs. Bikes and canoe are provided free which is a huge bonus. We were foolish enough to leave our glasses behind but Flip messaged us before we even realised and will post them back. A fantastic host with a fantastic boat in a stunning location. We cannot recommend this highly enough!"
27886,69887551,2016-04-14,24769997,Louise,"Flip er meget flink og imødekommende. Vi følte aldrig at vi manglede noget, tværtimod var der altid hjælp at hente. Hvis man manglede ideer og inspiration til hvad der var at se og udforske i Amsterdam var han altid klar med gode råd. "
27886,70206062,2016-04-17,8124712,Julie,We really enjoyed our stay in the houseboat. Good atmosphere. Beautiful. Clean. Great breakfast. Very convenient to have bikes. Flip is an absolutely great host. 
27886,70889419,2016-04-21,56260984,Judy,We really liked our stay on Flip's canal boat.  It is beautiful to be on the water. The boat had plenty of space with a very comfortable bed. It was also very quiet and peaceful. The breakfast was outstanding with many choices of food and more than one could eat.  Having bikes available to explore Amsterdam was a big plus.  The boat is in the heart of Amsterdam.  Flip also helped us call a cab to take us to the airport which made catching our flight easy.
27886,71228725,2016-04-24,49780212,Madlen,"Es war alles super!!! Ohne auch nur einen Mangel..., perfekt!
Das ist Amsterdam mal anders, eine tolle Abwechslung zu einem Hotel:-)"
27886,73063579,2016-05-06,17204815,Vanessa,We had a great stay on the Ms. Luctor. This is probably the best way to stay in Amsterdam. The location is perfect - close to the city center and the train station - but in a quiet and relaxing neighborhood.
27886,73442634,2016-05-08,44089664,Alyona,"Amsterdam is a crazy city! With a lot of people and bicycles( besides cars and trams). Full of new experience and freedom of mind. We found our silent and comfortable bay near the city central! Location is good, owner will offer to you bicycles - which you need to use if you are in Amsterdam!:) Flip prepared a brilliant breakfast!  You have to try it by your own- that cost it! It was a pleasure to stay in Flip's boat. Thank you, wish all the best to you and your family! "
27886,76459228,2016-05-27,17214239,Andrea Ørnes,"We can't think of a better location to live when in Amsterdam! It's in a quite area just a short walk away from the city centre. The two bikes enable you to explore the whole city. The houseboat is a very unique living experience. It's very cozy, functional and has everything you need. Flip is a caring and easy going host and he serves delicious breakfast everyday. We recommend this place highly. "
27886,77547212,2016-06-01,41309513,Emily,"I highly recommend this houseboat to anyone staying in Amsterdam. It is in a great location next to the central station stop. The boat is quiet at night and just across the water were lots of delicious restaurants and a bar or two. The pictures are very accurate and the houseboat was actually much nicer than I was expecting. Lots of hot water, lots of thoughtful amenities (like a little bluetooth speaker) and a super comfy bed! Breakfast was yummy too, I love Dutch cheese <3. I was actually really sad to leave. I could have lived there for a couple months easy no problem. Thank you to our lovely host, Flip, as well. We will be back next time we come to Amsterdam! "
27886,79856552,2016-06-14,34468582,Jessica,"My stay on the house boat was lovely, definitely one of the most unique Airbnbs I have stayed in.  The arrival process was very smooth as flip communicated with me via email to ensure everything was ready by he time I wanted to check in.  There was water and 2 local brews awaiting upon our arrival and the place was very clean.  We had 2 bikes with locks and a canoe to use at our disposal. The house boat is located very close to everything you will want to see in Amsterdam but is on a quiet canal which was relaxing.  There is a nice patio outside that we were able to drink wine on and watch boats go by on the canal.  The breakfast provided was delicious, fresh bread and croissants, cheese and sausage, eggs, jams and honey, cereal granola milk and yogurt.. More than enough for 2 people.  The bed is the most comfortable bed I slept in during my entire stay in Europe.  Additionally flip provides a book with any recommendations for restaurants and sites to see complete with maps and all.  Would definitely stay here again!"
27886,80304443,2016-06-17,14841733,Jayne,"Absolutely fantastic! We loved everything- the super comfy bed, the incredible sunsets, delish breakfasts, Flip is a pro! Would love to stay there again. The location for me was perfect, room to breathe but still in canal district.excellent place for a run as well."
27886,80999287,2016-06-20,58893350,Darragh,"We stayed for three nights in total and found Flip to be an excellent host! The houseboat is lovely, and in a great location within walking distance of town but yet quiet at the same time. The breakfast was fantastic, and having the bikes there is great if you fancy a spin around the city and the nearby park. Can't recommend it enough!"
27886,82813382,2016-06-29,5976299,Terri,"The houseboat was clean and lovely. Flip was friendly and the breakfast was bountiful and delicious. Make sure you lock it carefully at all times.

27886,84417722,2016-07-07,52365828,Katrina,AMAZING- from the moment we walked up to the dock it was great. Flip was friendly- gave us really great tips on shopping and food in the area gave us a great tour. best air bnb experience and really made our trip to amsterdam perfect.
27886,86563066,2016-07-17,747921,Liette,"This accommodation is a self-contained section of a bigger boat, where Flip lives. So the included breakfast (a very generous one!) comes fresh every morning served at your table. 
We've loved the outdoor section (at the end of the pier) with a table setting where we could have a drink at night watching the beautiful canal view and appreciating the calm of this area. You even get the fragrance of a jasmine bush, which is really lovely.
We've used the two bicycles everyday, which allowed us to easily access everything in Amsterdam. You can find everything in less than 5 min. away (cafés, restaurants, bars, grocery, and many very cute shops namely on Haarlemmerdijt/Haarlemmerstraat)
I recommend Flip's boat, as I couldn't imagine a better way to enjoy Amsterdam! "
27886,99396314,2016-09-04,12068228,Thien,"When in Amsterdam there is nothing better than staying in a house boat, Flip's boat is within walking distant to central station and the city centre. Having breakfast on the boat every morning was the highlight of our stay. "
27886,100778583,2016-09-10,65881899,Angela,"Fantastic stay! Great location, awesome accommodation, wonderful host. Definitely highly recommended. "
27886,101953754,2016-09-16,33054413,Sushma,"Flip was a great host! He accommodated us coming early and leaving early and it was so helpful! The breakfast he served was delicious and well thought out. The houseboat itself was lovely. We went in September and be aware that there are a lot of spiders around that time in Amsterdam but they are harmless (coming from someone who hates spiders) and none were inside the houseboat. The shower was better than I expected for a houseboat and was very refreshing with good water pressure. The toilet space is small but to be expected for a boat. The location is perfect. Super close to a bus stop and the bus system in Amsterdam is efficient. The bikes provided by Flip makes you feel like a real local. There is a small pier so that the houseboat feels more private and isolated while still being close to the main road and I loved that. Overall, an excellent stay and I highly recommend this place. "
27886,102339720,2016-09-17,71747970,Coral,Flip & Marjan were great. Flip helped us get a feel for the area and some awesome places to eat and shop. When we had to leave he helped us get a cab to get to the airport which was a tremendous help. Would definitely recommend! 
27886,103159034,2016-09-20,38324617,Emma-Lee,A perfect place to stay when exploring Amsterdam. Close to the central train station and CBD. The two bikes help to reach the hot spots which are a little further away. Flip is an excellent host. The breakfast served every morning in the room is very good. 
27886,105206204,2016-09-30,25595808,Carol,"Loved our stay on Flip's canal boat, perfect for a couple. We arrived early, well before check-in time, but were able to settle in right away. Breakfasts were amazing, such a treat to wake up to each morning. The boat's notebook suggested a handful of good restaurants nearby, we sampled two of them, and they were wonderful. So nice to be able to walk home from dinner. Quiet, restful, and excellent location. We took full advantage of the two bikes, perfect working condition, and would have taken out the canoe, but the weather turned before we could. All in all, it was a fabulous place to stay in Amsterdam, and we'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
27886,106243395,2016-10-05,26823141,Claudine,We arrived late in the afternoon and it was easy to locate from the central station. The place is easy to find using (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. The area is very secure and easy to access using taxi or bike or by foot. 
27886,107265622,2016-10-09,44319720,Jürgen,Wir hatten ein fantastisches Wochenende .Das Hausboot liegt super zentral .perfekt mit den beiden Fahrrädern.Flip hat uns verwöhnt mit einem tollen Frühstück.
27886,107614943,2016-10-11,92338031,Shari,"Unique experience. We loved it. Traditional Dutch breakfast was freshly made and delivered to us every morning. Good location, within walking distance to everything. Flip is awesome! "
27886,108698145,2016-10-16,3378024,Glen,"Absolutely loved our recent stay and trip to Amsterdam, nothing better than waking up with a view of the water and a perfectly made breakfast.

By far our best experience on Airbnb and cannot recommend Flip and his houseboat more.

"
27886,109239922,2016-10-20,21890894,Fabian,"The place is very close to the main station, a bus gets you there in no time! A 10-15 minute walk from the boat brings you to a bubbly lively area full of cafes and restaurants. It's very quiet, particularly cosy when rain drops fall on the boat - like camping, just a lot more comfortable! The place is equipped with everything you need, clean and nicely furnished. Make sure to take the canoe out if the weather agrees and swap trams and busses for Flips bikes! All in all highly recommended! "
27886,109863401,2016-10-23,62220449,Cliff,Very quaint and convenient to a bus stop
27886,110671632,2016-10-27,150823,Jennie,"This was such a unique and fun way to experience Amsterdam. The location near the Central Train Station and access to the bikes made for speedy travel. And even though the location was close to the center of Amsterdam, the boat was peaceful and serene. 

Breakfast was generous, and the hard boiled eggs were perfectly done. The centers had were solid, but still just a bit creamy. We were so full from breakfast that we skipped lunch most days. 

Flip was always available for questions, and his knowledge was very helpful in planning our trip around Europe. "
27886,111497157,2016-10-31,1928872,Camille,"Flip's houseboat was a wonderful find! We were just minutes away on bike from the center (with two bikes he provided us). Staying on the houseboat was super cozy and a very unique experience! The breakfast was absolutely delicious and he even accommodated some of my dietary needs which was nice! Eating breakfast on the boat, with the comfy robes he provided us was one of the highlights of our trip. He was also very accommodating with check in times. There were a lot of little nice details which made our stay a lot better! I would definitely recommend and stay here next time! Thanks flip "
27886,111859110,2016-11-02,73843256,Joy & Todd,We had a wonderful and unique experience in Amsterdam staying on Flips houseboat.  The location was within close walking distance to the city center but away enough for a quiet and peaceful stay.  Waking up eating breakfast in such a tranquil place on the water with beautiful views was an amazing way to start each morning for us.  Flip was always available to answer our questions and help us find our way around the city.
27886,112985594,2016-11-09,95100931,Stephanie,"Our stay was outstanding, the houseboat was so quiet and relaxing, the neighborhood safe and interesting, close to Amsterdam Central and surrounding area full of interesting shops and eating places. Flip was an awesome host, unobtrusive but very welcoming and responsive. The breakfasts were delicious. We will definitely come back.

"
27886,113921278,2016-11-14,1619305,Edwina,My husband and I stayed on Flips houseboat for two nights. We had a really lovely time. The weather was really cold during our stay and I was worried the boat would be cold but it was very cosy and warm with the heating on. The apartment is small but perfect for two. The bed is very comfortable. We slept so well and woke to a lovely breakfast each morning. It was a great start to our day! We didn't use the bikes as I found Amsterdam city too busy for cycling but we reached everywhere by foot. 
27886,115922213,2016-11-27,74965753,Cassandra,"We really enjoyed the two nights we spent on Flip’s boat and didn’t want to leave! It is such a wonderful, unique space and so well equipped that it soon felt like home. We slept incredibly well in the comfy bed and enjoyed the breakfast very much. I would definitely recommend Flip’s boat to anyone who is looking for somewhere quite unique to stay when they come to Amsterdam. "
27886,117284837,2016-12-06,13575831,Espen,"Good location, but also very very quiet. Great to have bikes ready for us. Three ovens makes it hot even in wintertime. Great breakfast. 2x bathrobes makes it seem like a spa. Should bring own slippers. Flip is an interesting guy, good conversationalist, even heard him practice singing with his family which was nice. "

27886,125508360,2017-01-06,18684006,Margaret,Flip's place is such a cool and unique place to stay while in Amsterdam. It's nice and quiet on the boat with a short walk to the main canals. The boat is well stocked (had extra power converters that we needed) and the breakfast every morning was wonderful.
27886,127304713,2017-01-17,41571542,Juliana,"We loved our first visit to Amsterdam (January) and this property was a perfect place to stay. It's located in a lovely and quiet area which is not too far to walk to the central parts of Amsterdam.

Flip is very friendly and the breakfast he brought for us each morning was generous and healthy!

There are a lot of houseboats to choose from but I'm extremely pleased with my choice to stay on the MS Luctor and would be very happy to stay again! We chose not to use the bikes or canoe on this visit but we'd love to try these out on another visit, perhaps when it's a little warmer.

If you're looking for somewhere to stay for a cosy, romantic getaway then you won't be disappointed if you choose to stay here. "

27886,131392836,2017-02-12,75379205,Brendan,"The accommodation on the Ms Luctor is very warm and cosy, even when it snowed outside.  It's a very clever use of space across the 3 decks/floors.  The bed was very comfy, the shower nice and warm & we were made to feel welcome by the host.  The breakfast is very good and plentiful...more than we could eat in fact.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place."

Apart from being a beautiful boat and a superb place to stay, the breakfasts were amazing and the location is perfect - we even walked from the central station easily (but we were travelling light). 

Flip was the ultimate host and really looked after us too - I'm sure we'll be back!"
27886,133250531,2017-02-21,49061457,Emmélie,Very lovely and comfortable houseboat in a quiet neighbourhood. A huge and delicious breakfast on the morning.

The bed was very comfortable, the heaters worked very well. Flip was a great host, he brought us a beautiful breakfast each morning.  To have the use of two bicycles was great. The house boat is very close to the center of Amsterdam but far enough away to be relaxing. I would highly recommend Flip and his wonderful house boat to everyone visiting Amsterdam!

Waking up on the water is such a wonderful experience and flips breakfast selection was very enjoyable while taking in the view. Definitely recommend dinner at Daalder, just a 10 min walk away. "
27886,151121632,2017-05-11,109505670,Michelle,"MS Luctor is a beautiful converted Dutch barge in a very picturesque and quiet area of Amsterdam. It is situated within easy walking or cycling distance of all the sights and makes the ideal base for a holiday in the city. The barge is very comfortable and cosy and gives one a sample of houseboat life. Flip, the owner, is the perfect host, very welcoming and friendly. Each morning he delivers a breakfast basket full of delicious food which really sets you up for the day. We had a fabulous holiday here and cannot recommend this property highly enough."
27886,151499612,2017-05-13,59504579,Stephen,"We had a fabulous Anniversary visit to Amsterdam on Flips houseboat.

Thanks again Flip and we'll see you guys next  year! "
27886,152110037,2017-05-15,92861378,Bob,This is a great location and close to everything. The boat was comfortable and clean. It was such a special way to spend our 2 days in Amsterdam. Flip was great and gave us privacy but also was helpful when we asked for tips. I would highly recommend. 
27886,152562911,2017-05-17,100401330,Jeri,We enjoyed our first houseboat stay and Our first visit to Amsterdam. The location was great because it was quiet yet only a short bike ride to the ferry or shopping. I am heartbroken I have to leave such a wonderful country but will be back soon I hope.

Wir haben uns auf dem Hausboot rundum wohlgefühlt. Besonders zu loben ist auch das Frühstück, dass jeden Tag liebevoll vorbereitet und von Flip gebracht wird. Vielen Dank für alles! Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder! "
27886,162481309,2017-06-21,11910878,Duncan,Flip's boat is a cozy little spot that is great for a couple. He provided a delicious breakfast each morning. We will definitely visit again if we return to Amsterdam.

27886,168153756,2017-07-09,68280726,Christin,"Bucht das rundum Wohlfühl-Programm bei Flip! Dieses Boot ist ein Wunder der Gemütlichkeit und hat so viel persönlichen Charme. Außerdem gibt es ALLES, was praktisch und angenehm ist. Dieses Boot ist nicht nur hübsch, sondern vor allem auch sehr durchdacht-intelligent eingerichtet. Wir sind verblüfft und voller Bewunderung. Die Lage könnte auch perfekter nicht sein. Wunderschöne Umgebung und gleichzeitig ein Katzensprung ins Zentrum. Die Krönung ist schließlich das grandiose Frühstück und die Mittel zur Fortbewegung inklusive. Und ganz besonders der so sehr sympathische Gastgeber. "
27886,169555876,2017-07-13,53329283,Francis,"We loved staying on Flip's boat. The location was great and it was easy to get into the centre of town from there. Flip provided a brilliant breakfast every morning that set us up for the day.  In particular, the freshly squeezed orange juice and still warm boiled egg were lovely touches.  Even though the boat is only 15 minutes walk from the central train station, the location was very very peaceful and quiet. The Westerdock bar around the corner (3 minutes walk) was very friendly with a great bar lady.  Highly recommended! "
27886,173472456,2017-07-23,125880311,Manu,"Wir hatten ein wunderschönes Wochenende hier verbracht. Das Hausboot ist der Wahnsinn, so durchdacht und schnucklig klein... mal was ganz anderes! Obwohl es mitten in der City ist (paar Min. mit den coolen Fahrrädern und man ist in der Stadt) ist es relativ ruhig dort . 15 min zu Fuss zu Central Station (Bahnhof). Das Frühstück hat wirklich ein extra grosses Lob verdient! Wir könnten immer draussen frühstücken bei herrlichem Wetter und tollen Ausblick! Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen
100% Weiterempfehlung !"
27886,189015986,2017-08-31,3056183,Anthony,"What an amazing spot!  Flip's place is everything you could want from Amsterdam.

The location is slightly off of the main tourist area so you get to be around locals and have some peace but are only a minute or two from a faster pace.
Your also right near one of the free ferries that takes you to northern Amsterdam, so convenient!

Flip went out of his way to make me feel welcome.  He gave great local spot recommendations and even gave me a rain jacket the day that I got to see the ""real"" Amsterdam (aka ""wet"")

The breakfast he served each morning was a feast!  I felt very spoiled sitting by the water eating delicious treats.

I'd recommend this spot to anyone! When I come back to Amsterdam I will be sure to book here again.
Thanks so much!"

27886,202841605,2017-10-13,152858268,Stefanie,"Das Hausboot ist sehr authentisch, minimalistisch eingerichtet. Ruhig gelegen zur belebten Innenstadt kann man sich den Sonnenuntergang am Steg ansehen. Flip ist sehr gastfreundlich und bringt jeden Morgen Frühstück mit frischem O-Saft, Müsli, Käse+Wurst. Zur Innenstadt sind es mit dem Rad (zur Bootbuchung inklusive) ein paar Minuten-perfekt wer nicht zu Fuß gehen möchte."
27886,203528914,2017-10-15,55799031,Nogah,"A lovely, super-tasteful boat in a great location - a short walk from the centre of Amsterdam but in a quiet dock. The breakfast was delicious and very generous and Flip very friendly and informative. It was really useful to have bicycles to get around town, though a bit scary riding as we are not used to reverse pedal brakes and the huge numbers and speed of other cyclists. The nearby part of central Amsterdam is absolutely beautiful."
27886,206202747,2017-10-24,27168617,Nick,"Great little houseboat on the canals. Cozy quarters, but comfortable and with a great host."

There is a great grocery store just down the street if you need anything. If you haven’t been to Amsterdam start here. It is a place that is just minutes from the city center. Also, the breakfast Flip provides is incredible. You are not going to find a better value and hospitality in the city."
27886,207398995,2017-10-29,5795695,Eliška,"Flip was very nice man. Breakfast was imazing. I recommend this place, it was amazing enjoyment."
27886,208395078,2017-11-01,151861876,Renuka,Flip's Ms. Luctor ist eine außergewöhliche und außergewöhlich schöne Unterkunft. Alles ist bis ins Detail sehr liebevoll eingerichtet. Die Lage ist hervorragend. Fahrräder inklusive sind super. Das Frühstück ist ebenfalls besonders. Und Flip ist ein toller Gastgeber. Alles in allem ein wunderschönen Rundumpaket!! Wir haben für 2 Euro den P+R Parkplatz Sloderdijk (oder ähnlich geschrieben) genutzt und sind ganz bequem mit dem Bus 22 dort hingefahren... Renuka und Michael
27886,210376972,2017-11-09,50813073,Kate,"Flip’s place is conveniently located, for easy access to Amsterdam. Being on a houseboat, will be a memorable and unique experience. The quarters are very clean and Flip provides a substantial breakfast spread. The pictures are accurate, however the space is quite small. Kitchen and laundry facilities are not available, there is a laundromat within a 10min walk and there are many good eating options around, be prepared to eat out every night though."
27886,211951525,2017-11-15,11342459,Dan,We had a wonderful stay on Flip’s houseboat!  All the reviews about Flip’s hospitality were so true and he proved to be the most kind and generous host.  The breakfast was wonderful and since we stayed pretty busy and made very early starts on most of the days on our trip Flip was kind enough to make a special trip to provide us with some sandwiches to keep us fed on our journey.   I cannot express enough how grateful we were for his hospitality.   As for the place it is perfectly as described.   Temperature dropped to just at freezing on our trip and we were worried that the boat would be cold but the heaters kept the space cozy and warm.  The bikes were a wonderful amenity and we made use of them to get around the city which was very helpful.   The space is wonderful and comfortable but is quite cozy.  It’s big enough for a couple to exist comfortably but you should be very comfortable with your partner as it is a pretty tight space.   That being said the bed was surely one of the most comfortable in all of my Airbnb experiences and we slept great while there.   Overall this place is highly recommended.
27886,212504047,2017-11-18,153425409,Alexandria,"Amazing 3 days spent on Flips boat. It is truley stunning and unique. The breakfast is fabulous. Location perfect, to see everything the amazing city has to offer. Would definitely recommend! Just fabulous "

BREAKFAST WAS SUPER AMAZING! 
We are going to miss it here very much. Ross has especially enjoyed waking up on the water and becoming friends with the ducks. We will definitely be coming back.

Have a wonderful Christmas and happy new year and see you soon. Ross and Teri, Bristol UK."
27886,222652945,2017-12-30,28505208,Sabine,"Wir sind Flop sehr dankbar, dass er sein außerordentlich schönes Plätzchen mit Gästen teilt. Sehr gerne kommen wir wieder, am liebsten im Sommer, um die tollen Zusätze wie Fahrrad, Kanu und Tisch am Steg zu genießen zu können. Aber auch das schlechte Wetter war nur halb so schlimm, weil wir uns an der mollig warmen Heizung und einem heißen Tee schnell wieder wohlfühlen konnten."
27886,224735417,2018-01-04,105077880,Nicholas,"If you are coming to Amsterdam then you have to stay on Flips boat. All the amenities of an apartment or hotel. Hot shower, comfy bed, good heat, and an amazing breakfast included. Very very clean and Flip is very thoughtful in the things he leaves in the space for you to use. Two free bikes as well, hard to beat everything that is included. Location is easy to get anywhere in a hurry as well, 5 min bike ride to central or Anne frank house."
27886,225350966,2018-01-06,18421614,Dorothy,Flips home was a great place to stay to get the full Amsterdam experience. The boat was so much fun and within walking distance of most things we wanted to see. Breakfast was great too! Would love to stay again.
27886,226020744,2018-01-08,161167694,Jannette,"I must say that this was a very unique experience. 
The room is nice, the bed is absolutely comfortable, the breakfast was delicious and Flip was a very friendly and nice host. 
I was a bit worried about staying in a boathouse during Winter but it was nice and warm. 
I  absolutely recommend this!"
27886,228141345,2018-01-18,5976708,Thomas,"Great location not far from Central Station. Ceiling on boat might be a bit low if your really tall. Bikes made everything available within minutes. Very quite and private, safe area for walking day or night."
27886,233141231,2018-02-08,17488097,Silvan,A very extraordinary place in the middle of amsterdam. Very cosy and nicely done house boat with love in the details. A perfect place to spend a few day's with your beloved person in the middle of this pulsing city.
27886,234302340,2018-02-12,12925289,Katherine,"Wow. Is all.
Staying on Ms. Luctor was the perfect way to spend a mini break in Amsterdam. There is so much we could say about it but you really need to discover it for yourself. Our highlights were eating delicious breakfast whilst sat in the cabin overlooking the canal, the use of the bikes to explore the city, and being able to come back to somewhere warm and cosy after a very cold day.
Thank you Flip - I hope we get to come back one day!"
27886,235291558,2018-02-16,127229547,Jake,"We had an amazing time in Amsterdam and Flip’s boat was lovely, the breakfast that was left every morning was very generous and delicious. Would recommend to everyone."
27886,238608485,2018-02-26,159009891,Caroline,Staying on the boat was such a novelty. The breakfast which was delivered to us every morning was outstanding. Lovely quiet location but very convenient to the city by foot !
27886,239121806,2018-02-28,29547231,Cindy,"A great place if you want something a little different. Warm, cozy, and a full breakfast. Would highly recommend."
27886,240094994,2018-03-04,22161193,Jerome,"Une perle!
La péniche de Flip est l’endroit parfait pour visiter la belle Amsterdam.
Par sa localisation, ses petits « plus » (vélos, guides à disposition...) et l’endroit en soit est juste parfait pour vivre la vie à la hollandaise.
Nous espérons pouvoir y revenir!!!

Merci Flip!"
27886,244667410,2018-03-19,24725499,Andy,Wonderful stay and a great experience. Book it!
27886,245428815,2018-03-22,110408107,Hamish,A fantastic and slightly quirky place to stay in Amsterdam.
27886,246265179,2018-03-25,44371788,Gila,"Flip’s houseboat was amazing ! Great location, charming and Flip was a wonderful host providing us with information and a scrumptious breakfast! What a delightful stay !"
27886,248256442,2018-03-31,21204025,Mihal,"Just like the reviews we read, the place was a great place to spend our days in Amsterdam! Very novel, very romantic, and Flip our host was extremely hospitable, friendly and helpful. The breakfast is tasty and fresh (freshly squeezed Orange juice!) And can fill you up till the afternoon!
We enjoyed ourselves very much!!
Highly recommended!!
Only one tiny detail- very tall people should consider that the ceilings are limited, they may have to bend over a bit, and bathroom a bit narrow. But otherwise, fantastic place!"
27886,249866624,2018-04-03,102500275,Gilles,Endroit atypique avec beaucoup de charme idéalement situé dans un quartier calme mais proche de la gare et du centre ville. Flip est un hote attentionné qui vous apporte le petit déjeuner tous les matins. La hauteur sous plafond est basse et à prendre en considération pour les personnes de plus 1.80m.
27886,250820225,2018-04-06,135215374,Nico,"We absolutely loved our stay on the boat. Fantastic view while having the excellent breakfast, everything clean and super comfy. Short distance to the Central Station and a bus station, short walk into the city centre. Flip was such a gentle person. Everything has been perfect!"
27886,251621822,2018-04-08,75237012,Derya,"Flip was de perfecte host en ons verblijf was heerlijk! De boot is prachtig, de locatie is erg goed gelegen met een super leuk uitzicht tijdens het ontbijt. Tijdens onze eerste volledige dag hebben we gebruik gemaakt van de fietsen. Enorm handig om Amsterdam mee te verkennen! We zullen zeker overwegen om nog een keertje terug te keren naar deze B&B bij ons volgend bezoekje aan Amsterdam! Flip, erg hartelijk bedankt!"
27886,257198079,2018-04-25,27706484,Mark&Kristen,"Great space, very clean and comfortable! Great breakfast included and bikes being included was an added plus."
27886,259701109,2018-05-01,158015259,Amanda,The views of the canals from the barge are wonderful. The best part is having the amazing breakfast in the wheel house and enjoying the view each day. Flip's place is a must for a true taste of Amsterdam.
27886,263452683,2018-05-12,174177993,Sibel,"Super tolle Unterkunft, klein aber fein. Morgens aufstehen und dein Frühstück ist schon auf dem Tisch herrlich. Das Bett super gemütlich. Die Lage mit den Fahrrädern erreicht man in 10Min. die Innenstadt."
27886,264930094,2018-05-15,20296456,Simone,Einfach nur perfekt!
27886,269342514,2018-05-27,3281600,Meagen,"Wonderful location a comfortable walk north of train station. Great atmosphere on the water. Was quiet, even Friday and Saturday nights. Flip provided delicious breakfast each morning; more than we could possibly eat.
The space was great. Bed was so comfortable. Great shower and all exceptionally clean.
Stay on Flip's boat for a unique Amsterdam stay."
27886,274906757,2018-06-10,71522898,Christian,"Emplacement parfait, 10mn a pied de la gare centrale; le bateau est situé dans un endroit tres calme; rien a redire sur le logement , tout est parfait comme sur les photos. le petit dej est impeccable et apporté vers 8h30 dans la cabine, libre a vous de le prendre plus tard. Nous sommes arrivés a 08h00 et en accord avec Flip,  nous avons  pu disposer de suite du logement;  les velos a dispos sont un plus, nous sommes à 5 minutes du centre et parfait pour se deplacer dans tout la ville. 
 nous ne regrettons pas notre choix, c etait parfait"
27886,276548802,2018-06-14,45672076,Kelsey,"Flip's place was AMAZING!!! If you are looking at any other apartment or house boat in Amsterdam just STOP and book this one now! 
The boat's location is outside of the city center which is great for peace & quiet.  His boat itself is super cute and perfect for a couple!  Just a small note: I'm 5'4 and my boyfriend is 6'.  I  could easily stand on every level, but my boyfriend had to slouch a little on the first floor where the steering wheel is and on the bottom where the bed is.  That was no issue though since we didn't spend a lot of time in there anyway and he could stand in the middle floor if he needed to :) 
Three concerns you may have that I had: 
1) The shower is great/like a normal shower, including water pressure 
2) the toilet is like a normal one as well ( a little loud if you flush at night and your partner is a light sleeper)
3) Even though you're on a boat, you can't tell. aka you shouldn't get ""boat legs"" or feel nauseous

Aside from the location and the boat itself, my other absolute favorite part was the thoughtful  breakfast he provided every morning.  Everything was DELICIOUS and it was so amazing and convenient to have it just ready for us every morning so we could get our day going ASAP!  He's very considerate of your privacy and makes sure the time he drops off the breakfast works for you. 

He also provided two bikes which was incredible.  We literally took them EVERYWHERE.  The only slightly negative thing I can say is the girl's bike/smaller bike was a little squeaky/old, but it worked just fine!  
There was also a super close bus stop, but we never used it aside from when we first arrived.  

another side note: If you get back late/want to stay in, UberEATS delivers there as well :) 

I hope I didn't leave anything out!  I would 100% stay there again for a future visit, and hope that I can!  
Seriously! Book this now!"
27886,277752710,2018-06-17,89310025,Laura,"Wonderful place, great setting and fantastic hospitality. Quiet at night and very comfortable stay with a lovely breakfast in the morning. Being able to bike around Amsterdam on the bikes supplied by Flip definitely made our weekend! "
27886,283248113,2018-06-29,149909110,Samira,Flip's place was exactly as described and amazing! We loved riding the bikes around Amsterdam and enjoyed waking up to a lovely breakfast basket from Flip. Would highly recommend staying here and is also in a great location :) 
27886,285928109,2018-07-05,37425121,GregnJoy,"Our adventure started with a no fuss check in, a casual bike ride (on Flips free use bikes) to the local store for cheese, crackers, wine and tapenade to settle in for our first evening on a gorgeous private little jetty overlooking the canals to enjoy our local feast. We were joined by Flip during the evening. He ensured we were checked in and comfortable and answered all our questions about the local attractions with warmth a smile befitting a generous host. Nothing was too much trouble and Flip even put the canoe in for us on the morning of our departure for a last minute paddle. The location is ideal. Close enough to the city to walk but far enough away to be peaceful. Can't recommend enough."
27886,298471915,2018-07-29,175468097,Samantha,"Great breakfast, use of bikes and beautiful stay."
27886,299601766,2018-07-31,70089137,Danielle,"Our stay on Flips Canal Boat was amazing. The location is so close to the center of Amsterdam. We had use of bikes and a canoe which was an awesome way to see Amsterdam. Flip was helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was amazing.  Thanks for the memories. 
"
27886,300851028,2018-08-03,50049671,Ashley,"WOW!  Our stay was the best part of our stay in Europe. Quiet and beautiful with an incredible host.  It was a 10 minute walk from the train station, and very easy to find.   The space was unbelievable.  There was more room  than we had anticipated in the shower, bedroom and lounging area.  Breakfast was waiting for us each morning with the option of eating inside or out on the jetty.  What a great way to start our days of touring the city.   s
We highly recommend Flip's place.  10/10. Thank you again Flip!"
27886,306015859,2018-08-12,65754370,Katie,Fantastic experience. Wonderful breakfast. Unique and special accommodation.
27886,311809358,2018-08-22,28707080,Jennifer,"Stay here! It is an amazing place!  So close but just far enough away to relax! The bikes are so very helpful on getting around town. Flip is a thoughtful and caring host! 
Thank you "

27886,318090271,2018-09-03,116900405,Emily,Flip was very  helpful and  considerate  of us and our allergies.  He was great to  chat too as well . Will  definitely  stay again  at this  romantic  house boat
27886,321831247,2018-09-11,109394420,Donald,"This boat is a gem. It is on a quiet canal only 15 minute walk to train station. Flip is a great host.  He brought a wonderful breakfast basket every morning with fresh breads, cereals, yogurt, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Check in was easy and the boat and bed very comfortable. Flip even printed our shuttle voucher to our next connection. The boat had a nice shower and coffee and tea maker. The dock was great for sitting on by the picnic table and it really feels as if you are living here. We even met his neighbour who is an eel fisherman. We would highly recommend the MS Luctor!"
27886,323186118,2018-09-15,61851540,Megan,Flip's houseboat was an amazing way to stay in Amsterdam. The breakfast each morning was incredible. The location was great (close to Centraal station). The space was very comfortable and clean. I would recommend staying at Flip's place.
27886,325301526,2018-09-19,10193839,Tom,Best   -AirBoat+Breakfast- you'll ever stay at!
27886,328411676,2018-09-26,73396983,Lynn,"This is a fun way to get to know Amsterdam.  An authentic houseboat, great location, really great breakfast every morning, and Flip (host) who is there to help with questions and special considerations making sure you have a nice visit."
27886,330303068,2018-09-30,130165703,Lee,"Great location, lovely boat with a great breakfast. Close enough to walk to Central station and there is a team stop across the dock."
27886,331324611,2018-10-02,167649269,Ivar,Highly recommend this place. It’s a 12min walk to center town. Quiet and beautiful
27886,332013670,2018-10-04,145839052,Beth,"We loved our stay on the Ms. Luctor.  Residential area, beautiful views, quiet, cozy and clean.  Flip was a wonderful host  and the information (and breakfast) were so appreciated and wonderful.  This is true Amsterdam and devoid of all tourists. Perfection."
27886,333986750,2018-10-08,140754974,Kristen,"Amazing houseboat in a quiet location that is perfect for exploring Amsterdam! The attention to detail, bikes  and breakfast made this even better than we had imagined!"

If I ever going to Amsterdam again, I will definitely stay at Flips houseboat again. 
I recommend it for anyone!"
27886,349759831,2018-11-18,37556669,Joe,Flip's houseboat is phenomenal. We absolutely loved our stay here and the only complaint was that we didn't have a longer stay booked in Amsterdam to enjoy it longer. We were a short walk to the center of town but far enough away that it was quiet and peaceful. The breakfast provided was top-notch. Flip is extremely kind and when we come back to Amsterdam we will definitely make it a point to stay here again.
27886,352478109,2018-11-25,13146173,Jenny,Great houseboat - lovely quiet location but not far from the action. Flip was very responsive and helpful. Great having the bikes on hand - loved using those. We would definitely recommend this place to our friends.
27886,356947283,2018-12-09,104757970,Hannah,"We loved our stay on the boat, so cosy and such a great space, the breakfast was a special touch. 20 minutes walk max to most places we wanted to go. Would definitely stay again"
27886,359139762,2018-12-16,84699877,Oliver,A quality establishment - perfect in every way - the breakfast was something else!
27886,361336356,2018-12-23,174594217,Mary,"Flip's houseboat was a great place to stay in Amsterdam. It was a fun experience staying on a houseboat, and everything about staying on Flip's was ideal. Flip was a kind host, the breakfast was great, the space was welcoming, and the location was nice. I highly recommend staying here!"
27886,364188355,2018-12-30,50470299,Jinnie,Prima plek! Het gebruik kunnen maken van fietsen is ontzettend fijn! We hebben genoten en komen hopelijk nog een keer terug!
27886,400823497,2019-01-13,93192318,Layla,"We had a superb stay. The houseboat was quirky and charming. Flip was a wonderful host, who provided lots of great local recommendations. We want to come back soon!"
27886,405391518,2019-01-27,61214106,Maud,"Tout est en accord avec l'annonce. Le logement est propre, bien situé, agréable. Le petit déjeuner est parfait et copieux. Flip est très réactif. Je ne peux que recommander."
27886,414324115,2019-02-19,188138575,Beverley,"A unique experience staying on Flip’s boat. Good location, easy access to the city.
Flip was a good host, warm and welcoming, nothing too much trouble.  
Bed was sooo comfy! Wonderful breakfast, freshly prepared each morning."
27886,417190219,2019-02-26,46229559,Yash,"In Amsterdam I got live on both a boat and an apartment. If I were to do it again, I would choose the boat. The location is amazing and the boat is really cool. It has everything you need, including a private bathroom with a shower. Flip is a really accommodating host and did an awesome job with breakfast. The boat is really close to the main city where everything is happening. If you would like to amplify your Amsterdam experience, come stay at Flip's place."
27886,419532528,2019-03-04,1593944,Xavier,"Agréable séjour dans un lieu sympathique et cosy. Quartier calme  avec des restaurants de qualité à proximité. Centre-ville rapidement accessible à pied.
Flip est disponible et son petit-déjeuner est très appréciable !"
27886,423469641,2019-03-14,5364881,Catherine,"This experience is not for everyone but I for one am glad I tried it and would stay again.  The boat is charming, interesting, unique, clean, comfortable and well situated. Having said that, it is not like a generic big box  hotel with instant hot water and little connection to the outside world. 
 Personally, I was relaxed by the sounds of the water, rain and  calls of the birds.  I spend three nights here with my teenage daughter and despite the fact there was a television, it was barely turned on. I treasure the leisurely breakfasts we spend watching the water, the birds, the goings on around us and simply talking.  Something tells me the breakfast conversations would not have had the same quality had we been at the Hilton. 
 Flip is a very accommodating host who respected our privacy but also made us feel very safe and welcome.  I am glad to have exposed my daughter to an alternative to big box hotels and would definitely stay again. Thank you Flip for your kindness and hospitality."
27886,424790978,2019-03-17,114485659,Наталья,Самое лучшее жилье!
27886,431534495,2019-04-01,40567942,Johnny,Brilliant stay as a couple - short walk to busy streets with all the food and shopping you need. Bickers was a great restaurant local to the AirBNB - Flip was welcoming and the breakfast was as good as everyone says!
27886,432571323,2019-04-04,248451601,Pascal,"Gastgeber super Freundlich, sehr schönes Boot. Haben die Zeit echt genossen!"
27886,435359898,2019-04-10,83046913,Lucie,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour sur la péniche de Flip qui est très bien située (15min à pied de la gare centrale), l'endroit est calme et dépaysant. Le logement est propre. Deux vélos sont à disposition et le petit déjeuner est servi à 8h30 et est copieux. On serait bien resté un peu plus... Je ne peux que recommander :) !!!"
27886,442805300,2019-04-24,243628633,Laurie-Anne,Un superbe endroit et un hôte super. Nous recommandons !
27886,443488821,2019-04-26,26629780,Chi Hang,It would be a fabulous experience to stay in a boathouse in Amsterdam.
27886,445850760,2019-04-30,69326282,Poon,A great stay. The host is super nice and helpful guy.
27886,447768670,2019-05-04,213100221,Fabrice,"Très bons moments passés à bord de la péniche , tout était impeccable. Hôte prévenant et attentif à nos besoins . Petit déjeuner excellent et varié ."
27886,450324621,2019-05-09,146104622,Karen,"Lovely, romantic get away within walking distance from the heart of Amsterdam. The bed is very comfortable, and the breakfast was wonderful! Truly the highlight of our trip."
27886,454967607,2019-05-19,63583490,Camilla,"Our stay at Flip’s houseboat definitly made our trip to Amsterdam even more memorable. It was an amazing experience staying on a houseboat and made it even better starting everyday with the most delicious breakfast served by Flip. 
Only thing to be aware of (If you’re tall) is the low ceiling. But didn’t made the stay any less recommendable.

We also enjoyed the possibility to bike around in the City with the two bikes accesible - just like biking around in Copenhagen.

Thanks again for your kind hospitality. We will definitly come back, if we ever should visit Amsterdam again ;-)

Best regards, 
Emil & Camilla, Denmark"
27886,457552429,2019-05-24,164697280,Linda,"Our favorite part about staying at Flip’s was beginning and ending our day with food and drink on the houseboat deck. As others have mentioned the breakfast was amazing and Flip was available for any questions we had.  The neighborhood across the canal was lovely to walk in and restaurants were close by. 
Probably not a great place for tall individuals as the bedroom is quite low and going up the stairs we both whacked our heads 
( it is a boat after all ).  
I would highly recommend as it was quite charming."
27886,467887632,2019-06-11,152175788,Doug,"Flip’s boat was awesome. Being on a canal, in an old boat, was a fantastic change of pace from the hotels my son and I have been staying at throughout Europe. Flip is a great host, and the breakfast he provides every morning is not only delicious but plenty to hold you over until dinner. The houseboat also comes with two bikes which we fully used to get around. Just a great time and an enjoyable place to stay while in Amsterdam."
27886,468746046,2019-06-13,163591320,Ian,"Flip's house boat was amazing. We had the best holiday staying there. So clean, welcoming and in a great location. Wish we could have stayed longer. Can't wait to return!"
27886,479656861,2019-07-01,8657353,Meghan,Absolutely worth getting as your place to stay in Amsterdam. The breakfast is amazing and the space is super comfortable. We loved it!
27886,506974241,2019-08-11,96691687,Martin,"Das Hausboot ist mal eine andere Art der Übernachtung, passt aber super zu Amsterdam und den Grachten. Natürlich ist es etwas beengt aber für ein Haussboot ist das normal und eher gemütlich/kuschelig. Die eigene Dusche und (getrennte) Toilette waren genauso sauber wie das ganze Boot. Morgens gab es ein kleines, leckeres Frühstück - zubereitet von Flip. Zur Innen- bzw. Altstadt sind es ca. 10-15 Minuten zu Fuß. Schneller geht es mit den Fahrrädern, die im Preis mit eingeschlossen sind."
27886,517211855,2019-08-25,13095922,Clara,Flip’s houseboat is ideally located not far from the station but in a quiet neighbourhood. The space is great and we had everything we needed for a fabulous stay. Flip is a helpful and friendly host who helped us make the most of our visit. We really appreciated the bikes and the canoe!
27886,521004343,2019-08-31,117523142,Stephane,"Great cosy place, perfect location."
27886,524158011,2019-09-05,68576097,Joanne,"Nice quiet area about a 15 minute walk from Amsterdam centraal station.
We were greeted and shown around the boat. Had bikes ready for us and lots of info about the sites to see.
Small space onboard but that's to be expected on a boat.
Flip provided a fantastic breakfast each morning and was lovely to chat to."
27886,528091290,2019-09-12,255872344,Liza,This was a great place.  Flip was a fantastic host. No recommend this houseboat.
27886,530049441,2019-09-15,250557190,Dirk,"Ihr werdet einen aufmerksamen und zuvorkommenden Gastgeber kennenlernen, der sich liebevoll um jedes Detail auf dem Boot gekümmert hat, angefangen vom Frühstück bis hin zur schön ausgebauten und dekorierten Kabine."
27886,531378604,2019-09-17,46961209,Mariko,What a great experience! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a unique accommodation. Nothing beats waking up and having fresh breakfast provided by Flip on the canal. The use of bikes made a big difference and made the whole experience feel much more authentic.
27886,533172536,2019-09-21,90865678,Katharine,"Flip was an amazing host. His attention to detail is on point. The ability to use the canoe made the break. His introduction to the area, where to go and what to do made navigating the area much easier. Hope he gets many more guests. Thanks Flip."
27886,544815048,2019-10-11,47029901,Johanna,"Flip’s houseboat was the highlight of our stay in Amsterdam! He greeted us upon check in and gave us a tour of the houseboat and some great recommendations. The space itself is small but cozy! If you’re tall you’ll have to watch your head in some spots. We had to use the heat during our stay and it worked perfectly to keep us warm during the chilly nights. Flip was such a generous and thoughtful host and brought us a lovely picnic basket breakfast each morning. When we told him we’d be checking out early in the morning, he even offered to give us sandwiches for the journey to our next destination. Staying here was truly an experience to remember and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Amsterdam!"
27886,560546567,2019-11-07,89560625,Bryan,Lovely houseboat at the canal with a generous and fresh serving of sumptuous breakfast. Definitely will be staying again if we visit Amsterdam.
27886,562662450,2019-11-11,18825835,Arash,"Flip’s place is incredibly charming and in a nice area of town—fairly accessible to everything, but far out enough that it’s kind of quaint and quiet. The houseboat itself is awesome, and Flip is generally a rally considerate and great host."
28871,82539,2010-08-22,163752,Dave,Very nice place and people.  Great location!  Made our vacation very fun.
28871,21518912,2014-10-19,20597737,Zuzana,"We were at the double room and I don't have anything wrong to say. The room was clean and cozy, house in the best location. Edwin is really nice, fun and ready to answer all questions. There is just one rule: don't let out the cat! Hope to come back sometime."
28871,26293687,2015-02-09,20543694,Melissa,"Edwin is friendly and humorous guide, his house is
warm and sweet, I really enjoyed it when I stayed in Amsterdam. It's really convenient just located in central."
28871,32450201,2015-05-18,26175845,Franz,"Nos ha gustado mucho el sitio de Edwin, esta increiblemente bien ubicado y es encantador, Edwin nos ha tratado muy bien y se duerme genial. Muy recomendable. Solo hay q tomar en cuenta que la escalera es un poco estrecha y que el baño es compartido. Pero vale la pena 100% !!! "
28871,32686822,2015-05-20,29217313,Maria,"I didn't actually see Edwin because he was out of town on business. He left someone to meet me at the apartment. My overall experience was good. The main attractions are about a 15-20 minute walk. The apartment is surrounded by restaurants. The only thing I would say is that the wifi did not work for me, on the third floor. I had to go down to the first floor in order to use it. There was good communication before and after my stay. "
28871,43652726,2015-08-21,12791640,Alexandre,"Edwin est très acceuillant, souriant et fort sympathique. Tout était très propre. La chambre est plutôt spacieuse. La salle de bain / WC est partagée, mais tred bien entretenue et très propre aussi. 
Il y a un peu de bruit venant de la rue, mais rien d'insurmontable. 
Thx 4 the warning about the car. That's true, free place to park your car doesn't exist in centrum =)"
28871,46473957,2015-09-11,35784734,Hanna,"Fantastic experience, perfect destination not to far out of the centre. 
Edwin was a wonderful host and we thank him very much for everything he did for us whilst staying at his house. We will be back again. :) "
28871,51423919,2015-10-20,15212907,Lenka,"Me and my friend had a wonderful time at Edwins place. The house is right in the heart of Amsterdam. Everything's reachable within walking distance.
The room was nice and cosy as the rest. Edwin is a great host and such a kind person. And we just loved his cat Pookie.  "
28871,54468310,2015-11-20,4497539,Benjamin,"I've stayed at Edwin's several times before, precisely because he's a great host, friendly, helpful and has a great authentic setting with which to welcome his guests. The house is fantastic, the rooms are cosy and the location is ideally situated in the southern centre of the city. Therefore, the access to the canal belt is easy and gives you the nearby choice of heading east or west along the Herengracht, Keizersgracht or the Prinsengracht. "
28871,65737689,2016-03-16,54083589,Sofia,La habitación era muy limpia y agradable... Edwin nos recibió muy bien y nos ayudó con sus consejos para ubicarnos...El baño siempre estaba limpio...

28871,67880106,2016-04-01,57323316,Marissa,"We LOVED edwin's apartment. We stayed in the double on the second floor. Edwin had a cute little coffee bar right outside of our room which was really nice in the morning. the bed was comfy, with a tv in the room (though we didnt watch it). It's located right above a really cute cafe, in a really cool area of town near the markets. Edwin did a great job of decorating with really unique art pieces. The best part was his kitty Pookie; she came up and hung out with us for a while on both days of our stay. The bedroom and bathroom were both spacious, well stocked, and clean. Edwin was super friendly and answered our questions and even checked to make sure we were having a good time! I'll definitely book this location again if and when we ever come back to Amsterdam!"
28871,68885670,2016-04-07,58915521,Santiago Nicolas,"Edwin es un genio. Muy amable, cordial y divertido! La casa estuvo perfecta. Limpia, linda y muy bien ubicada. Muy recomendable!"

The room was lovely and a nice size for my husband and I. Edwin also answered all of our questions, gave us tips for things to see in the city and generally made us feel comfortable. I would definitely stay at the guest house the next time I am in Amsterdam. "

Need only to improve the wifi (now is very slow). A little bit noisy street in the night (till 2/3 o' clock morning clubs near the room are crowded)."

The room and the bed was clean and comfortable, and sufficient for two people. Edwin is very nice and gave us useful information and great tips about the city. He even kept  our luggage during the day after our check out. We would love to stay at the same place again and would recommend it to everyone."

See you in Germany, Edwin. Thanks!"

Edwin was always available, very attentive and keeps the pace very tidied up. Loved his energy. He easily became a friend. I couldn't have asked for a better host in my two weeks of traveling in Europe. I would definitely recommend people to stay with him if you are traveling alone or a small group."

At night there was some noise as described but it's not an issue unless you are a super light sleeper and can't sleep without absolute silence. My wife did have some issues sleeping, but it was OK for me. "

Bedroom and bathroom small but clean and with confortable temperature. The street has some noise at noght but location is a must.

Communication with Edwin was awesome. He is a very nice guy.  The place looks exactly like the pics and the house was very clean.
I can only recommend this home."

28871,133522986,2017-02-23,55549982,Lucie,"We had a very good time in Edwin's house, well located, maybe a little bit noizy during the weekend. Edwin is a wonderful person (as his cat) and really takes care of what you need. We recommend his chambers for those who want to be in the city center, near everything, and desire a nice stay in Amsterdam ! Enjoy !"
28871,135235458,2017-03-04,33735419,Jose,"Gran ubicación! Es cierto lo del ruido por las noches, muy cerca de bares y restaurantes. Todo está a distancias caminables. "

It is right by the tulip market, and there are variety of fun restaurants/bars along the adjacent street. Edwin was very welcoming, and the room was exactly as it was described. Would definitely recommend!!!"
28871,139052062,2017-03-23,27213859,Camille,"Le point fort de cet appartement est qu'il est vraiment bien situé, à quelques pas du centre et dans une rue animée. Si vous avez le sommeil léger, pensez juste à amener une paire de boules quies car la chambre n'est pas très bien insonorisée. Sinon la chambre est très propre, bien chauffée et le lit confortable. La salle de bain est petite mais fonctionnelle. 
Edwin s'est montré très disponible et réactif. Il nous a bien expliqué comment rejoindre son appartement. Pensez à le prévenir si vous êtes allergique au chat afin d'éviter une visite de son adorable maine coon. 
En bref, je vous le conseille :)

28871,143050828,2017-04-10,26590145,Yatzury,This place is a gem! Is in the middle of everything. I walked everywhere and there are a ton of restaurants and bars in the area if you don't want to go too far. Edwin is amazing and was clear in his communication and he was very helpful with any questions or requests i may have. Keep in mind this is in the middle of a busy area in Ams if you are looking for a quiet place this is not it but if you are looking to have the best time stay here. 
28871,143987472,2017-04-14,90587247,Sophia,"Staying at Edwin's was a real pleasure. He's a really friendly person, who has nice hints on what to see in Amsterdam. The room was clean, nicely decorated and the wifi worked. If we'll ever be back again, we will definitely come back. "
28871,145445691,2017-04-18,4569313,Kevin & Evelyn,"Edwin's place is great! We stayed for a short stay over the Easter weekend and absolutely loved it's location and convenience to all of the sights and to the central station to catch our next train. The room was very comfortable and just as listed. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the shared bathroom was kept tidy. We would definitely recommend staying with Edwin, he is very friendly and made sure we were comfortable during our stay. "
28871,146008689,2017-04-21,51330599,Melanie,"Die Lage der Unterkunft ist genial. Das Zimmer hatte ausreichend platz und das Bad war direkt nebenan.
Von den Mitbewohnern haben wir nichts mitbekommen. Die Eingangstür klemmt extrem aber keine Panik, sie öffnet sich wenn man weis wie!
Wir würden wieder bei Edwin buchen! Top!"
28871,146912217,2017-04-24,92632137,Srta,"I recommed Edwin's house If you want to visit Amsterdam. Edwin makes to feel you like at home. House is clean, cute and well-ubicated. "
28871,149592126,2017-05-05,16412758,Angélique,"La chambre est conforme à la description de l'annonce, Edwin nous a parfaitement bien indiqué comment trouver la maison en arrivant de l'aéroport. Dommage que l'on ne l'ait pas vu du reste de notre séjour après notre arrivée....
Le lit est très confortable mais la rue à côté du logement est très brillante jusqu'à tard dans la nuit... Et pas de chance au moment où nous sommes allés dans le logement d'Edwin, il y avait des travaux dans le bâtiment d'à côté et donc réveillé très tôt le matin...."
28871,150447273,2017-05-08,15334952,Arisa,"Edwin the host is very friendly and helpful. The place is clean. The bathroom is shared with the other room but it's totally fine. The location is really really great too.  It's close to various restaurants and shopping streets and supermarkets and all kinds of shops which is perfect for people who like to go out at night. The only downside is that it's not might be considered walkable for some from the central station but there's a tram station literally 1-minute-walk away from the place.
My personal tip: do not bring large luggages because you'll have a problem drag them up the steep and narrow stairs"
28871,150954014,2017-05-10,118827861,Troy,Edwin was a great host and his place is directly in the middle of anywhere you would want to go.

28871,154544404,2017-05-25,3372519,Bridie,"It's my second time staying at Edwin's and I was not disappointed!

You can't beat the area, close to all major attractions and easily accessible from Centraal station via tram or walking (if you don't have much luggage).

The location is in a fun and vibrant area, there are bars close by, so expect to hear a little street noise, but no issues getting to sleep whatsoever in the comfortable bed!

Edwin is great for communication, prompt and friendly, and went out of his way to ensure we could store our bags while exploring on the last day.

Can't recommend highly enough!"

Does get loud at night with the bars and in the mornings with garbage trucks, but if you're not a light sleeper it's not a big deal. Edwin was very helpful during our stay with his recommendations and willingness to help. Highly recommended!  "

With his many recommendations, we ended up having a blast exploring the local food, shops, and museums. The room was clean and cozy, perfect for two.

Check in was super easy due to great communication. Edwin is wonderful and will offer many suggestions on meals and sights to see. He is hilarious and will help you in any way you need. His cat Pookie will also come hang out if you are lucky. Thanks Edwin!"

Easy to get to Central Station, Anne Frank, Heineken, Hard Rock.   Lots of walkable restaurants.   Only reason didn't give five stars is it is a noisy neighborhood till wee hours.  If you're a party person great, a sleeper, not so much.
Host was very accommodating with delayed check-in due to flight delay"

The place is clean, offers more than just a stay but a soul to get the full experience! You're literally above a coffeeshop if that's something you're interested in although you won't be bothered by people visiting it. There are some amazing places in the area and you're not that far off from anything in Amsterdam! It was amazing experience!"

We only stayed 2 nights but really liked Edwins place because the bedroom is so damn big and the whole building is unique and Edwin is such a lovely person.

The location is in the center of the city, with the flower market right around the corner along with great bakeries, coffee shops, etc. There's a supermarket around the corner as well. Everything is walking distance which is super convenient and if you choose to take the tram, it's located one street away.

When we were staying here it was quite warm so we needed to have the window open. I'd suggest bringing earplugs. If you're a light sleeper maybe look for something in a quieter area.

The location is perfect, very central, close to many lovely restaurants and behind the flower market. There was a tea/coffee station provided with a small fridge&freezer - I particularly appreciated the ice as the weather was hot also the fan in our room. 
Edwin also has the most beautiful cat I have ever seen . We would definitely stay again"
28871,269256784,2018-05-27,24653805,Fiorella,"Edwin nos atendió muy bien desde que llegamos. La habitación es amplia y cómoda. El baño es compartido pero está muy bien y tiene todas las comodidades. Hay frigobar y café y té para el desayuno. La ubicación es excelente. Se puede hacer todo caminando , hay muchos bares en la cuadra pero no nos impidió dormir ya que no se escuchaba por las noches. Sin duda volveríamos a hospedarnos "

28871,276195398,2018-06-13,156830555,Katie,"Edwin was such a great host. Communication was clear and fast and he had some wonderful tips for places to eat and check out nearby. The apartment itself was clean and as described, and the bathroom was cleaned daily and thoroughly. Some nice amenities like hairspray were also provided in the bathroom and were a nice touch. It was the perfect location for our quick stay in Amsterdam and a great value. Thank you Edwin for a great stay! "

28871,279230045,2018-06-20,86011269,Caitlin,"This is my second time staying at Edwin’s place and it is probably my favourite Airbnb i have stayed in. You get the real “Amsterdam” feel when you stay here. It’s close to everything and only a short walk to the red light district, the main strip and dam square. Edwin is such a great person and his cat Pookie just adds to the greatness. Would highly recommend anyone to stay here on their next trip to Amsterdam! "
28871,280498109,2018-06-23,144928592,Kyle,"My wife and I stayed at Edwins for two nights. We absolutely loved it. One of the best Airbnb's I have stayed in. It is perfectly situated on the corner of a busy street with everything you need for a true Amsterdam experience. Don't hestitate & book this accomdation ASAP, you will NOT regret it. Kyle & Sarah"
28871,282452571,2018-06-27,15955199,辛根,"房間是山型屋的樓上,因為樓梯比較狹窄所以行李多的會比較辛苦些,但是房子位置左右都有Trem可搭,而且後方就是花市,地理位置非常棒,房東也是非常熱情,有任何問題都能請他協助,有機會還會想住"
28871,283107921,2018-06-29,109535547,Valerie,Edwin was very pleasant and helpful!
28871,284081376,2018-07-01,114707361,Annika,"We had such a nice stay at Edwin! The apartment is really nice and the area it’s located in is amazing. Of Course it was a bit louder as it was in the party area, but as Edwin gave us a fan we just closed the window and everything was nice. :) the check-in/-out was really uncomplicated. The cute cat visited us once but she just relaxed in the room for a while. The room was so nice you felt welcome from the beginning. It was a really nice time and Edwin is a really great host! :)"
28871,285920531,2018-07-05,24456085,Laura,"Such a lovely room with an easily accessible shower, and access to a mini fridge and tea/coffee which was a nice touch. Everything was very clean and homely. Edwin was an amazing host, very attentive and gave us some great local recommendations. The location is perfect, just a short walk to the centre of the city and an even shorter walk to a vibrant square with lots of bars and restaurants. Thank you very much for such a lovely time in Amsterdam!"

28871,290913784,2018-07-15,1784099,Marjorie,"Edwin's place is a delight. The pictures and the details on the ad were spot on. Edwin was a communicative, warm, and helpful host. The room is a good size, and the house is a lovely traditional dutch structure. We were able to explore the city on foot due to the central location. At night, the neighborhood comes alive and is quite loud. We slept with ear plugs in and were just fine. Also, if you've never experienced dutch architecture, the stairs are often closer to ladders; which we found fun and charming, but may be an issue for people with even slight mobility issues. All in all, we're very happy we stayed."
28871,292528138,2018-07-18,149685131,Yasmin,Very welcoming
28871,293430326,2018-07-20,198415699,Isabella,"I stayed a couple days by Edwin's place in the double room and loved it. The house is clean and Edwin is a very good host, polite and funny.  Highly recommend! "

28871,322168727,2018-09-12,10532487,Michael,Great location and Edwin is a very friendly host
28871,325309463,2018-09-19,80531148,Danni,Edwin is a lovely host and has a lovely house too! The house is really authentic and has a cool vibe that you wouldn't otherwise get with a hotel. Staying in his house makes you feel like a local with the winding stairs inside and old style building. Being so central is also great because you can walk anywhere or jump on the tram which is close by. I definitely recommend!
28871,326946644,2018-09-23,28010238,Alexandros,"Excellent host, downtown location, amazing vfm! Absolutely recommended!"

28871,328818643,2018-09-27,106890089,Aline,"The place is great! Surprises me that Edwin was so thoughtful and the room and bathroom were both well equipped. Also, the host is lovely, he even gave us tips to go to another little town, but we couldn't go there yet. I'm sure I will go back to Amsterdam a couple of times, as it's quick and cheap from England, and I'll probably stay at Edwin's guest house, cause it's really nice and chill. Thank you Edwin, for being a great person and running a nice place ♥ :)"

28871,332417828,2018-10-05,170877093,Christian,"This apartment was amazing. Beyond our expectations. It is very centrally located, we had no problem getting around town. Edwin was a great host. Our flight was canceled, so we would not be arriving until very late at night. He stayed up until we got to the apartment, so he could welcome us. We appreciated the hospitality, especially after difficult travel issues. It is located near active bars, but we had no issues sleeping."
28871,337741276,2018-10-17,144182339,Thainá Castro,"A localização da casa de Edwin é maravilhosa! É possível ir para os principais lugares e pontos turísticos a pé. Fica localizado em uma rua cheia de restaurantes, com bastante movimento, inclusive a noite, o que faz ser um pouco barulhento, mas não foi nenhum problema para nós. Edwin é super simpático e engraçado. Como é um quarto com banheiro compartilhado estávamos um pouco receosos quanto à limpeza do banheiro, mas Edwin limpava-o todos os dias e não tivemos problema nenhum. Ficamos muito satisfeitos e recomendamos muito o local."
28871,339075072,2018-10-21,40352056,Karen,"5 Stars and really good find for central Dam. I really enjoyed my stay, Edwin is a superb host would stay again for sure."

convenient location and the host were superrrrrrrrr nice"
28871,341165152,2018-10-26,18982166,Katie,"This space could not be more ideally located! Edwin was a great host, very responsive and welcoming, even helping with our luggage up the steep Dutch stairs. While the location is central and ideal we are glad we brought some ear plugs to drown out the noise from the street. Our private room was very comfortable and we did not run into too many issues with a shared bathroom."
28871,343006581,2018-10-30,100451482,Alfonso,Excellent host

28871,347379178,2018-11-11,64658869,Ching,Edwin's place is just perfect. It's located in the heart of Amsterdam and everything is just a walk away. He is very helpful and accommodating. Our first night was just amazing.  Edwin suggested that we must dine in this famouse Chinese restaurant which is 10 min away from his place. It was sooooo good. We will definitely stay again in his place next time we visit Amsterdam. Kisses to your fluffy super cute cat!
28871,348323000,2018-11-13,221094790,Marise,It was amazing!!!!

28871,357729610,2018-12-11,150814929,Rachel,"Great location in the heart of the city. We had all of the basic amenities we needed, and everything was spotlessly clean. Edwin is incredibly friendly, and we felt very welcome in his home. Only thing is you absolutely have to be able to get up and down stairs which were no problem for us. Overall, incredible stay. We preferred it so much to staying in a hotel."
28871,359137850,2018-12-16,190386309,Andreas,"tolle Lage, sehr freundlicher Vermieter, das Zimmer ist etwas abgewohnt, kein TV im Zimmer, schlechte Internetverbindung, sehr schmales Treppenhaus."

28871,362410636,2018-12-26,38346818,Maddie,"Truly the best location you could find, especially for the great value. Two towels per guest, free access to laundry with detergent, convenient bathroom, and quite literally the best hospitality from Edwin I could expect and more. The stairs up to the rooms are QUITE STEEP -- if you have mobility problems, don't stay here. Also, don't plan on being able to use the wifi to stream shows or do  a lot of web surfing, but there's enough power to facetime for a minute and to message/use your Maps app. Not a big deal, because why are you using your phone when you're traveling abroad?! A+++ for Edwin and his kitty!"
28871,363602639,2018-12-29,136172252,Julia,The location of the airbnb is excellent!!
28871,365229358,2019-01-01,82527779,Kathryn,"The location is perfect! We stayed over New Year and we were close enough to walk to everything we needed to, but far enough away to not hear the mayhem. 
We had difficulty connecting to the WiFi during our stay, but Edwin always responded quickly to our messages, even though he wasn’t around during our visit. 
I would definitely recommend Edwin’s place!"
28871,366804104,2019-01-03,132190335,Nitchanan,Lovely and cozy spot. Super easy to go almost everywhere you need to go in Amsterdam. Definitely come back again!
28871,400505380,2019-01-12,114195341,Pablo,excelente ubicación. el lugar es tal cual en las fotos. lo único incómodo pueden ser las escaleras si viajas con gran equipaje.
28871,401329239,2019-01-14,38385777,Beatrice,"Posizione ottima, vicina a tutto e piena di ristoranti e locali nelle vicinanze.  Stanza bella, come da foto e pulita. Unica pecca: non è stato possibile lasciare la valigia al check out e il luggage storage vicino è caro (7€ a valigia)."
28871,402080107,2019-01-17,212206811,Loreto,"Location is perfect for 2 or 3 nights. Everything is close to walk (city center, red Light District, Heineken Factory, nightclubs). Edwin was a great hostess even if he wasn’t in the house. He was very helpful. His cat is gorgeous, she gave us a quick visit during the mornings . Small room, tight stairs but location is amazing."
28871,403041127,2019-01-20,27453804,Melissa,Everything was fine! Its a cool and cosy place and also very central - because of that it is a bit noisy at night but it didn't bother us much and we could sleep well.

28871,419588436,2019-03-04,84801033,Melba,Edwin is the perfect host in a perfect location!!! I recommend his place without reserve if you want to know Armsterdam.

28871,421367275,2019-03-09,26011858,Leon,"Great comfy room in in great location for seeing all the sites.

Tram and convenience store super close.

On all fronts the description was exctaly spot on.   However I gave it 4 out if 5 as our overall experience was that the noise was sometimes excessive and went on till 4 in the morning. 

Tea and coffee nice touch.

Edwin was a super  host and went out of his way to help us out.   

Highly recommended."
28871,422861902,2019-03-12,43806730,Franziska,"Edwin gave us a warm welcome and showed us around. The location is perfect, very easy to reach everywhere by foot. Also super easy to get to from Park and Ride location. Would recommend!"

28871,424908235,2019-03-17,59312114,James,"I woyks recommend anyone to stay at Edwin's guest house. His home is in a great location, literally minutes from bars, shops and restaurants. Edwin is very polite and friendly abd will make sure your stay is off to a good start"
28871,426507678,2019-03-21,1407685,Kristal,"If you're lucky enough to see this room available when you're traveling to Amsterdam, book it! NOW! Edwin was an excellent host -- very nice, friendly, and funny as hell. The stairs were not too bad; we climbed steeper steps in Cuba. The bathroom is shared but was always super clean. There is some street noise from the club and bars down the street, but I slept with earplugs just fine (I'm a super light sleeper). The location CANNOT be beat. It's a few minutes walk to ANYWHERE in central Amsterdam; less than 5 min walk to multiple tram lines. We can't wait to come back to Amsterdam and we'll definitely see if this room is available again-- we would book again for sure! Thanks for the best place to crash in all of Amsterdam, Edwin!"
28871,429245944,2019-03-27,211486243,Harry,"Absolutely amazing host and amazing place! Great location to all of Amsterdams delights, room and bathroom very clean and tidy. Edwin was a great host and would highly recommend!!!"
28871,430818383,2019-03-31,44191189,Juan Carlos,"La casa está muy bien situada. Está en una calle de zona de marcha, con bares y restaurantes. Por la noches hay mucho jaleo y el ruido de la música y las voces se dejan sentir. Si estás acostumbrado a dormir sin ninguno ruido, no podrás pegar ojo hasta las 3am que es cuando cierran los bares. Luego completo silencio. Cómo nosotros llegábamos rendidos a la habitación de patear la ciudad, no nos enteramos del ruido. La cama es muy cómoda y la habitación bien caliente. El baño es compartido, es pequeño pero siempre limpio y sin olores desagradables."
28871,432254553,2019-04-03,13904539,Meagan,"Edwin's Guesthouse is centrally located, clean, transit accessible, and within walking distance of so many shops, restaurants, etc. - a great home base for exploring. And Edwin is a great host, very responsive to my questions and honest up front about the noise in the area (Nb I just brought ear plugs, and was fine to sleep). He had suggestions on where to see heaps of seasonal flowers, and the transit directions he provided to his place were clear. Do note steep and narrow stairs to the rooms from the main entrance."
28871,435018902,2019-04-09,59432165,Nicola,"Abbiamo soggiornato da Edwin 3 notti. È un ragazzo molto disponibile e non perde l’occasione per dare un consiglio e rendersi utile. La stanza è in un’ottima posizione, comoda per muoversi in qualsiasi direzione. Si trova in una via laterale del bloemenmarket, vicino a tutti i punti di interesse, a 20 minuti a piedi dalla stazione centrale. Noi ce la siamo girata tutta a piedi ma volendo è comodo anche noleggiare una bicicletta. Se dovessimo tornare ad Amsterdam sicuramente ricontatteremmo Edwin. L’unica cosa che consiglio sono i tappi per le orecchie :) essendo una posizione molto centrale nel week è un po’ caotica. A presto Edwin  grazie di tutto!!!"
28871,435740495,2019-04-11,101780564,Grant,"Can’t get a better location. Heaps on your front door step and even more within a 5 minute walk. Very easy to get to from the centraal station as the tram drops you off down the end of the street.
Really cool coffee shops on the street too, very chilled.
Edwin is funny and very helpful and keeps the place pretty clean. 
Not your own bathroom but really who cares, room is private and lockable.
Great value for money!"
28871,437133976,2019-04-14,170069062,Saif,"Edwin is a wonderful host. Our stay was comfortable and nice. Location is just 1 km form central station, perfect to explore the city and surrounding regions."

28871,439011951,2019-04-18,210745290,Anouk,"La chambre est super sympa, on s’y sent chez sois !
Comme dit dans les commentaires, l’emplacement est vraiment parfait on y est à proximité de tous les points d’intérêts de la ville.
Le quartier est très sympa, un peu bruyant mais voyons le bon côté, il y a une chouette ambiance ! ;)"
28871,441761957,2019-04-22,165215202,Bhumit,Very nice location. Reasonably priced.

28871,443481006,2019-04-26,66062071,Sean,"Edwin was a fantastic host!! His place is in a great central location close to everything; it is clean, comfortable and convenient...but most importantly Edwin himself is a friendly courteous host, and a good person."
28871,444621172,2019-04-28,162007253,Stephanie,Great location and easy to get to via public transport. Edwin was really friendly and helpful. Good communication and we would definitely stay again. Thank you!
28871,446737969,2019-05-02,59938960,Cambria,"Edwin had all the fantastic food recommendations. The location  of the Airbnb was excellent! A true feel for the city. We got to experience a soccer win while we were there so it was a bit noisy at night, but that’s to be expected with the central location. Very good host!"
28871,447901426,2019-05-04,26873211,William,Very nice place in a very good location. Edwin was so helpful and attentive.
28871,449644640,2019-05-07,153926138,Chantal,"Excelente ubicación, lugar limpio, aunque compartes baño nunca nos tocó cruzar con otras personas, Edwin muy atento y divertido!"
28871,451142011,2019-05-11,213747799,Anthony,Great area To stay in Amsterdam you can walk literally anywhere.  The room and bathroom were perfect and Edwin was an absolutely amazing host he went above and beyond on everything for us.
28871,452550686,2019-05-13,159753270,María José,"Esta casa esta en pleno centro, al lado del tranvía y comercio... Muy cerca de todo para ir caminando. La habitación es lo que muestran las fotos, un lugar cómodo y limpio. Está ubicado en un barrio bohemio con un poco de ruido por los restorants y pubs pero no impide dormir por la noche, con unos tapones es suficiente. 
Volvería sin duda a casa de Edwin."
28871,453593126,2019-05-16,2618971,Sally,You get what you pay for here...Amsterdam is very pricey. Edwin is a great host and super sweet. If you just want a place to crash and don’t mind a pretty busy neighborhood that is noisy all night then go for it. I am a terrible sleeper so it was not for me. Also others mention the steep stairs...if that’s at all an issue because you have a big piece of luggage or have climbing issues this is something to be mindful of.
28871,457030797,2019-05-23,42683358,Lucie,We could not recommend Edwin's place more. It was everything we needed for a few days in Amsterdam. It was also really clean and right in the centre of the city. Edwin is really welcoming and has lots of great tips. Thanks for being such a wonderful host!
28871,458647676,2019-05-26,74145592,Jessica,"Absolutely perfect. Best location to explore Amsterdam by foot. We barely left the neighborhood and we saw so much! Would definitely stay again. Only negative is how loud it could be at night, recommend a couple Advil PM for this place (;"
28871,461287286,2019-05-31,23423896,Lou,Edwin was a wonderful host with the most amazing apartment in the heart of it all. Everything was walking distance. The apartment was super clean as well as the shared bathroom. Edwin was quick with responses and a wonderful communicator. I look forward to my next trip here and to stay at Edwin’s once again! :)
28871,462640076,2019-06-02,163523637,Skylar,"Edwin was a really great host. He gave fast replies and detailed local traveling tips whenever my friend and I had a question. We loved his personality - he’s funny, very welcoming and vibrant, just like a good friend! 

The room was very comfortable and spacious enough to open two big luggages at the same time. The bathroom was clean. Teas and coffee were provided and we loved a big cup of hot tea after a long day visit!!!!"
28871,464317752,2019-06-05,154121406,Facundo Javier,"Edwin es muy buen anfitrión. Siempre está atento a los mensajes. Su alojamiento tiene varios puntos a favor: la habitación (me alojé en la doble con mi novia) es muy amplia y la cama es súper cómoda, el baño está excelente (buena presión de ducha y temperatura del agua), y la ubicación es bastante buena (está a metros del imperdible Flowers Markets y tiene bares y restaurantes muy cerca). Pese a ser compartido, no tuvimos problemas para el uso del baño. Había una chica en la habitación de al lado y una pareja en la de arriba. Un aspecto a mejorar es el Wifi, que funciona muy mal. En conclusión, nos fuimos muy conformes y volveríamos a elegirlo en un posible futuro viaje a Ámsterdam."
28871,465674448,2019-06-08,13591814,Katelyn,"Edwin was so friendly and happy to help, full of local tips. Great location, with Amsterdam at your doorstep. Highly recommend. You actually do not feel as though you are in Edwins apartment either as you enter the house and continue up a set of stairs straight to your room (with a second rented room across the way) and the bathroom is right outside your room. Good setup."
28871,471236786,2019-06-17,209519318,Christine,My sister and I had an amazing trip to Amsterdam. We can’t thank Edwin enough for everything! He is truly amazing and super friendly. Amazing location— close to everything and anything. The bed we slept in was super comfortable.
28871,472245518,2019-06-19,59238973,Matt,"The best place to stay in Amsterdam hands down!! If you're lucky enough to stay here then your trip will be instantly improved. Easily the best location. Close to great nightlife, parks, great food, even better drink, and just everything you want. Bed is comfortable, towels were provided for showering. Simply. Perfect."

28871,480302638,2019-07-02,162196972,Evelyn,"Edwin’s double room had a perfect location in the city centre, with most sights being within walking distance. Our room and bathroom were spotless, and Edwin went out of his way to help us with luggage, check-in and provided us with recommendations. Thankyou, we can’t wait to come back!"
28871,482243223,2019-07-06,122347860,Jessica,We enjoyed our stay at Edwins place. Was a perfect neighborhood to be in close to everything Amsterdam has to offer. Street noise is there on a Friday and Saturday but with a fan and the window closed you barely notice it. Would stay here again if in Amsterdam.
28871,484203016,2019-07-08,225643159,Kelcione,"Edward foi super atencioso, sempre respondida as mensagens com minhas dúvidas; a localização é maravilhosa, o quarto e o banheiro são  limpos e organizados. Adorei e recomendo. Voltarei com certeza."

28871,491363172,2019-07-20,4838548,Steve,"Thanks for a great couple of days in Amsterdam. The room is just fine for two, up two flights of spiral staircase but no problem to negotiate with backpacks. Wifi is a bit patchy but a downtown free option is also available."
28871,500479833,2019-08-02,53766301,Victoria,Great little place for resting your head! Edwin was v communicative and followed up quickly.

A 100 mts se encuentra el famoso mercado de flores y se puede llegar a todos los puntos de interés caminando sin ningún problema. Edwin nos recibió de la mejor manera, es un gran anfitrión. La habitación es grande y cómoda. Sin dudas volvería en la próxima visita a Amsterdam!"
28871,515189226,2019-08-22,228242619,James,Edwin is a friendly and attentive host. Always willing to offer advice on local amenities and travel. The room was cosy with a nice view of the street below.

28871,518885128,2019-08-27,44883343,Bev,"Edwin offers exactly as advertised- a comfortable double room. I’ll add that all facilities were clean too. Bathroom was shared but this didn’t cause any problems and was located just outside the room, as was a small fridge and the makings for coffee/tea. Communication was clear and prompt and the location is great, with plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops close. Tram stop just a couple of minutes walk away.  Recommend for solo traveller."
28871,519815434,2019-08-29,37993528,Mary,Amazing location right in the middle of everything close to sights and restaurant also public transport. The place is very clean and would stay here again!
28871,521543063,2019-09-01,240476061,Clara,"Very lovely apartment and a very friendly host. Everything was perfect except of the fact that it wasn't really quiet at night because of the central location. But if you wanted to go on parties anyways, it's perfect for you:)"
28871,523329574,2019-09-03,184703787,Rachael,Wonderful space and even better host!

28871,527103761,2019-09-10,98729465,Lexi,"We enjoyed our stay very much! Great location! Edwin is a great host. Walking distance to all the attractions, cafes and bars. Very impressed with the food especially all the vegan cafes and vegan options in most restaurants. The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was great, lots of hot water. My only complaint was the wifi being slow!"
28871,527997582,2019-09-12,199340416,Olivia,"The location of the room is perfect! It is about a minute away from the tram stop and very close to the centre of Amsterdam and the station. The room was immaculate, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the shower was really nice. There was tea and coffee provided as well, which was a lovely touch. Furthermore, Edwin is a really friendly host and responded within minutes if I had any questions, I highly recommend staying here!"
28871,531250708,2019-09-17,167145418,Jeanne,"We had a very nice time at Edwin's place, the flat location is ideal to discover the city, even if it's a bit noisy. Edwin is the perfect host ! We would come back without hesitation !"
28871,532090258,2019-09-19,103909589,Susan,"Stayed twice in this trip with Edwin.  Best host we have ever had.  Amazing location, I sleep very light and was not kept up by any noise of any kind.  Highly recommend."
28871,535349320,2019-09-24,240069327,Nicolas,Todo excelente!
28871,536670415,2019-09-27,29919280,Katie,"Edwins place was great! As the other reviewers say, it’s right in the middle of everything which is so convenient. The neighborhood has tons of restaurants, bars and shops to visit, but there is also a tram station very close to get to the rest of the city. 

The space was really comfortable and clean. It is a little noisy outside but that quieted down by midnight when we were there. We slept very comfortably. 

Edwin was a great host and super communicative and friendly. We also got to meet his cat which was fun. The WiFi was a little spotty for us, so I wouldn’t recommend the place if you are planning to get a lot of work done, but it worked fine enough for us to scroll the internet on our phone. All in all I would highly recommend Edwins place when visiting Amsterdam!"
28871,539442531,2019-10-01,226728559,Courtney,Edwins place is great! It’s easy to get to to just about everything in Amsterdam and he is super easy to work with :)

28871,544106982,2019-10-09,188356172,Nicolas,"La habitación está increíble, la ubicación es súper cómoda ya que está a algunas cuadras del barrio rojo y no llega toda la gente, aunque la cuadra de la casa está repleta de bares y restaurantes pero que no molestan para dormir. Esta casa está impecable, Edwin es un gran anfitrión."
28871,545460380,2019-10-12,257532497,Burcu,Edwin is a really nice host. I recommed to stay in here to everyone. Location is really close to everwhere.

Extremamente limpo, organizado e um espaço agradável! Com certeza voltaríamos."
28871,551435385,2019-10-20,7104408,Marije,"Very clean and cosy room with a very good bed. You share the bathroom with one other room. Coffee and tea facilities available. In the middle of the centre, top location. Very good restaurant for breakfast and lunch at the end of the street called Studio 2, best coffee in town!"
28871,552736142,2019-10-22,116707462,Diana,"Edwin was súper nice and the appartment was comfortable and in a perfect location, try the fish that they sell near there in a little cart, it was delicious!"
28871,552799661,2019-10-22,248111952,Josh,The host canceled this reservation 52 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
28871,554358829,2019-10-26,64977983,Michael,Edwin was very helpful when we arrived early with our luggage. He allowed us to check in early which was great after a long travel. His location is perfect as it is extremely central to everything in Amsterdam.
28871,559983797,2019-11-05,51495270,Jessica,"Hospedagem maravilhosa, tudo extremamente limpo, quarto confortável, o Edwin é super simpático e prestativo. Simplesmente incrível!"
28871,561300118,2019-11-09,137575721,Dalmiro,"Muy buena estadía en casa de Edwin. El muy amable y predispuesto a ayudar con todo. La ubicación es inmejorable (próxima a todos los puntos de interés). Por la noche es una zona rodeada de bares y restaurantes. El único detalle es que por ser tan movida la zona, a la noche se escucha bastante el ruido."
28871,562822315,2019-11-11,24891539,Margaux,"Our stay was perfect! Edwin’s appartement is very well located, so clean and cozy. We felt at home ! Edwin is really welcoming and his cat is so beautiful ! We came back for sur."
28871,564223159,2019-11-15,114535940,Andrew,Edwin was very accommodating by helping me with my luggage. He allowed me to drop it off before check in and come back for it after the check out time while I was out doing something for the day. Would definitely recommend staying with Edwin.
28871,565292060,2019-11-17,255299108,Danny,"We enjoyed our stay at Edwin's place. Would stay again if back in Amsterdam. 

Communication with Edwin was helpful and responses were quick. Easy check in/out process. Towels and shower gel etc provided. 

Great location, if not a bit loud in the evening (weekend stay) as it is near a lively bar scene. 

Edwin does have a cat which wasn't a problem but just a note for anyone with allergies."
28871,566670640,2019-11-20,30331147,Katie,"We had a great two night stay. The apartment is clean and tidy with interesting artwork and books in the room. The nearest metro was a 5 minute walk away, very handy! We would happily book to stay next time we’re back."
28871,567721689,2019-11-23,153367423,Kassandra,Edwin’s apartment is centrally located which adds so much convenience. He also shares great local tips and recommendations!
29051,200622,2011-03-16,401414,Elzbieta,"Not a long ago I stood at  Downtown Guesthouse in Amsterdam.
It was really wonderful to stay  right in the center of the old city. 
Sint Jorisstraat leads near the Flower Market and Kenigsplein.
The host is a very nice, open minded person. You have no  any problems with the arrival – he is also helpful with everything you need staying as the guest. The ""single room"" is a small, nice and quite room. The street has the special nice atmosphere typical for the old town. If you want to spend really  nice time visiting museums, walking on the streets looking at  the canals you could not choose the best place. In the future ff i will visit Amsterdam I would like stay  as a guest at Downtown Guesthouse (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
29051,244699,2011-04-29,44565,Augu,"Edwin is fenomenal! The place is located in the center, and the room was perfect.  Can't wait to go there again.
"
29051,266197,2011-05-16,543630,Darren,"Great location, room was very clean and even smelled good.
There are lots of restaurants in the area, and it can be a bit loud 
at night but who goes to Amsterdam to get sleep??????
Edwin was quick to respond to my emails and I will definately stay here the next time I am in Amsterdam."
29051,297209,2011-06-04,595831,Fleur,"Such fantastic hosts, and a perfect place to stay in Amsterdam! The accommodation is really homely, while also giving you lots of privacy- Such a nice change from the sterile hotel rooms I usually stay in! Edwin puts lots of energy into keeping it clean and comfortable, and is always such a delight to bump into. I couldn’t say 1 bad thing about these fabulous hosts and their beautiful home. Thanks so much for having me! "
29051,334378,2011-06-25,726162,Chrissy,"Edwin is lovely, and the room was great! 5*!"
29051,458874,2011-08-19,483342,Paul & Dominique,Great location right in the center of Amsterdam. Edwin is very friendly and accomodating and keeps the place clean.
29051,513505,2011-09-08,930503,Avital,"Had the perfect 2 nights staying at Edwin's place in the vibrant centre of Amsterdam, walking distance to all museums and attractions, the place is full of charm and charachter, if you're concernrd about night noise, a set of earplugs will solve the problem! will definitly stay there again in my next visit.  "
29051,619737,2011-10-11,647999,Kali,"I loved this place. I stayed at a few different places during my trip, and the location here is pretty ideal. Transportation is great, but it is central enough that you can walk to most places you would want without trouble, and it is enough out of the heart of the city to be a little more sane. The room is great, and Edwin is an excellent host. I will definitely think about returning here in the future."
29051,737058,2011-11-22,334072,Gwendolyn,"Edwin is a charming host. He's very helpful and fun. And a neat-freak, which is great--who doesn't enjoy fresh towels, clean floors and fresh flowers in the entrance? The location was perfect for me as it was a five minute walk from where I needed to go every day throughout my week long stay. I would also warn others, however, that the neighborhood is indeed lively (and therefore quite noisy) at night. I slept fine, and was very cozy. "
29051,939061,2012-02-21,40768,Adam,"Edwin offers a comfortable room in a historic house in an incredible location.  Having stayed in several guest rooms in Amsterdam, I can say that Edwin's was spacious for the city, and it was fun to stay in a home dating back to the 1600s.  

The Reguliers area is vibrant, with a nice mix of clubs and restaurants, yet just far enough away from Central Station to avoid the crassest tourist traps.  But, with a less-than-five-minute walk to Dam Square, Edwin's house is still in the heart of the city.

Edwin was extremely accommodating, offering detailed directions to the home and having the room and towels ready and waiting when I arrived.  He was also there to greet me and offer some helpful tips, but didn't impose.  I enjoyed full privacy during my stay.

In short, Edwin is a competent, trustworthy, and welcoming host with a great private room, and I'd be glad to stay again.  "
29051,990793,2012-03-12,1673307,Ian,Excellent location and very friendly host! Recommended.
29051,1009731,2012-03-17,1580,Jakob,"Edwin´s house from the 16. century is nicely located right next to the city center. The major sights should be within walking distance, altough I must admit I was on business in the city and can´t say to much about the touristic aspects. Edwin is a very friendly and helpful host, and the price for his room is very good. The room itself was clean and even had a Flat-TV with a nice DVD collection. One should know that you share the bathroom with other guests who can book a second room in the house. The room I rent could fit two persons, but if you have a lot of luggage, it would be to small. The biggest problem I think is the noise: The street under the window is very lively at night, but the windows and walls can´t keep that noise out. If you are in the city for partying, the room is perfect, but if you seek some sleep, you´ll probably want to book another room."
29051,1837003,2012-07-30,2483036,Chan,"the place is a hot spot to enjoy night life in Amsterdam. and Edwin was very cheerful and nice person. even though it was kind a noisy untill the last night but to enjoy real Amsterdam, It is a perfect place. "
29051,2437991,2012-09-28,3469614,Wiley,"I had a wonderful time staying at Edwin's while in Amsterdam. After I booked initially, there was a double-booking situation and Edwin quickly took care of it and offered me the spare room at an attractive rate. And it was perfect for my needs. The location is unbelievable. It's right in the center of the city without being too obnoxious or touristy. I will definitely visit again on my next trip to Amsterdam.

Also, I got into a little bit of a bike wreck while in town and Edwin took great care to get me the information that I needed regarding urgent care facilities. Great host!"
29051,3064247,2012-12-11,4159281,Roberto,"Edwin was great, nice friendly & chilled guy with a great place in a good area, highly freccomended!"
29051,3234209,2013-01-02,4497539,Benjamin,"Edwin was very welcoming, extremely helpful and a great host. The room was really cosy and it only enhanced my awesome New Year experience. Next time I'm in Amsterdam, I'd love to get the same room again!"
29051,3439883,2013-01-29,1150618,Marina,"It was exactly what I needed. Good location, friendly host, even some nespresso in the morning. 
I managed to see the entire city and had real fun despite on the rain. "
29051,3863034,2013-03-22,4249470,Iris,"Didn't get to say goodbye so let me take this way to say THANK YOU to Edwin! He has been a fantastic host. He went out of his way to make my stay cozy and memorable. The room was wonderful, I hardly wanted to leave the bed in the mornings. I had plenty of space for all my stuff and the whole flat is decorated in a very unique stylish way. The apartment is set right in the centre of everything, it's perfect. Edwin made sure I had everything and really took great care of everything. I can only recommend staying with him and would love to come back."
29051,3978357,2013-04-01,4625785,Orann,"The room is very comfortable and is perfectly located within close proximity to shops, attractions and there's a tram station at the end of the street. A couple of considerations though, there's is a steep narrow staircase to climb to get to the room, so a bit tricky with large luggage. Also, the house is located in a popular cafe street, so if staying over weekends, it can get a little loud at night so bring ear plugs. Otherwise. I had a great stay, and Edwin the host is really helpful and nice as well. Orann"
29051,4086175,2013-04-08,632859,Aku,"Very lively neighbourhood and cozy place to stay. Just like the previous reviews have told, there are lots of restaurants, bars and clubs and it's very close to the city center. I was able to walk prettymuch everywhere I had to go. Edwin was very friendly and attentive host."
29051,4385482,2013-05-01,1902644,Andrew,"The room was exactly as advertised.  It was very clean, comfortable and has a perfect location in Amsterdam.  Edwin was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again."
29051,4663321,2013-05-19,5349201,Jordan,"Edwin is a complete sweetheart who happens to have an incredible room in a great location. His room is incredibly clean and comfortable. It can be noisy but if you want to be out enjoying Amsterdam at night with curtains for napping in the day and all the sights a quick walk away, you won't find a better value. I would definitely recommend Edwin's guesthouse for a trip to Amsterdam as long as it's not for dates when I will be returning! "
29051,4747081,2013-05-23,2747473,Les,"Edwin and Patrick were great hosts. These guys were very friendly, attentive  and accommodating. I need to mention how clean both the room and the bathroom were. Coffee and tea were available. Staying in a 400 years old house was an experience. The location could not have been any better. I would and probably will come back again. Thanks guys."
29051,4830851,2013-05-28,4069281,Romain,Very good location if you want to enjoy amsterdam night life. The room is cosy and very clean.
29051,4875906,2013-05-30,5669301,Zoraida,"Edwin was great as a host. When I arrived, he offered to me immediately a refreshing drink. His place was very clean, and right in the center city very closed to everything. Also, his display of painting makes the place very cozy. I enjoyed so much the coffee he had for his guests. It's a supermarket very close to the place making easier for a low budget travel. Don't forget to try the chips with mayonnaise (french fries)...I was in Amsterdam for only two days which it went too (Website hidden by Airbnb) enough time to visit everything in the city....wishing for more days .... Edwin was very helpful with directions and visit tips....
Thanks so much Edwin...looking forward to return to your place....  "
29051,5238445,2013-06-19,6089857,Robert,I had a great stay with Edwin in Amsterdam the place was in a perfect location right near the flower market and close enough to walk to everything. I'm pretty tall so the  shower is quite small but clean which is all that really matters. If Im ever in Amsterdam again i'll be sure to consider staying with edwin. 
29051,5395422,2013-06-28,5215034,Alexander,"Edwin's place was amazing. The location could simply not be any more central (easy access from the airport too). 
The room was sunny and nicely decorated. And actually bigger than it looks on the picture! Everything was very clean, and I had a great experience staying there. Edwin was helpful and kind. He gave me a map of the city on my first day and provided helpful suggestions on where to eat, go out, etc. 
I will certainly book the place again when I am next in Amsterdam. "
29051,5759133,2013-07-15,1869786,Sol,the room was very nice and the location was excellent. The only disadvantage is that the street is very noissy. Edwin was very nice and flexible
29051,5984703,2013-07-25,6239688,Lauren,"I HIGHLY recommend a stay with Edwin. The room was adorable, comfortable, and very clean. The location is perfect; I never had to get on a train because I could walk everywhere. Yes, it can be a little loud (on Saturday night, a lot loud), but I put in some earplugs when I went to bed and it was fine. I mean, loud is good; it means you are where everyone else wants to be! Edwin is very kind, funny, and very approachable, but he also let me to my own devices and gave me complete privacy. This place is a great deal for the area, and I enjoyed it more than most hotels I've stayed in. You won't regret staying here. :-)

Just to echo some of the warnings that others have shared: 
1. You do have to walk up a narrow flight of stairs, so if you have ridiculous amounts of giant luggage, you many not find it easy to get up there.
2. If you are over about 6'2"", you may have to duck a bit in the shower. :-)
3. Saturday night is one of the loudest things I've ever heard. But, like I said, earplugs are a travelers friend if you don't feel like joining the fun.

But, seriously, stay here. :-)"
29051,6272044,2013-08-06,5967185,Matthew,Great location.  Charming room!  It has everything that you need.  The picture doesn't show the huge windows that allow great sunlight and a spectacular view of the street.  Edwin is fantastic.  The best host ever!
29051,6521646,2013-08-15,7024433,Rana,"We had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam thanks to Edwin. 
The place is very cute, and perfectly located. you won't need any public transportation. you can simply walk to the tourist attractions.  I highly recommend Edwin's place. and I hope I can go there in my future trips."
29051,6764290,2013-08-24,2206955,Dufy,"Great place to stay, in the middle of it all. And the room is nice."
29051,6867031,2013-08-28,1795549,Sultan,"The host was amazing - very cheerful and helpful. The directions on how to get to the guesthouse that were provided were very easy to follow and made the place simple to find. The room was clean and exactly as described. The location is perfect, accessible, and central. The host was also knowledgable and available if you had any inquiries about the area/surrounding areas. I had a very pleasant first experience using Airbnb!"
29051,6936562,2013-08-31,1445103,Sunny,"Edwin's place was great, central and convenient, walkable to all the places around the inner city. The room itself is cute and quaint, similar to what other reviews mentioned, it can be a bit loud at night, however, that's because its in amongst the lively part of town. "
29051,7092248,2013-09-06,6271923,David,"I will be back

Location: This guesthouse was highly convenient. It is between two rail stops (one on each end of the block).  I walked from here to Central Station and the Museum District because there are many sites to see along the way.  For a gay person there are also conveniences of bars being just outside. 

Edwin: he is a really nice guy and has many travel tips so one does not get mugged, pickpocket, or lose valuable travel documents.  He is eccentric and nice. You may not see him often, but you should say 'hi' when you do. 

Accommodation: I use the place simply as a resting place. There is one restroom to share with the other guest room. Each room has its own key. If you are fortunate to get the room facing the street you struck gold.  When using the restroom do all you need to in one use because if you leave to go get something the other guest may hop in and you're stuck waiting a while. "
29051,7329518,2013-09-16,1382101,Martin,"We stayed on a Saturday night and it was quite possibly
Just environment I have ever try to sleep in. Things in our room were literally shaking with base and I felt like my pillow was on top of a sub-woofer. Otherwise, he was a gracious host."
29051,7433250,2013-09-20,6823746,Raphael,"Edwin has created a very welcoming house.  Clean, inviting and a really cute spiral staircase leads to rooms.  Located mid-Amsterdam, most of the city is walking distance away.  I found Edwin to be very likable and helpful.  I needed some items from a pharmacy and was having trouble finding what I needed.  He insisted on showing me the pharmacy he thought would have what I was looking for.  He was right!  Edwin had me laughing.  Bring earplugs because street noise can be intense.  I highly recommend Edwin and his place in downtown Amsterdsm.  "
29051,7490750,2013-09-22,1380414,Kate,"Edwin is a delightful host, helpful and conscientious. Altho he emailed excellent directions, he was hanging out on the street, waiting for me. He spotted me walking with luggage & called out a greeting. My room was spotless. His location is great: walking distance to everything. His street has many restaurants, so can be noisy at night; but after a hard day touring, I had no trouble falling asleep in the extremely comfortable bed."
29051,7745132,2013-10-01,4629039,Riley,"great location. Amazing host that can give you any information you need. Edwin is a beautiful, kind hearted person. A pleasure to stay with. I would definitely recommend staying at his nice little room over looking this cute little walking street."
29051,7806216,2013-10-04,6125182,Jacob,"Edwin is a great hoste, easy to communicate with, and a very personable man. The room was clean and comfortable, so was the bathroom. The location is great, although noicy as informed by Edvin. All in all a great stay !"
29051,8136789,2013-10-17,5942655,Ashley,Edwin is great! Supper friendly and welcoming. The room was great and he provided coffee and tea which was great to get over the jet lag :)
29051,8565183,2013-11-05,9035266,Denise,"I love everything ! Its a comfortable house and room .
If you need help, it is available .
Edwin is a good person, funny and has a cute cat !
I recommend it !
Thank you again Edwin .

From Amy adams ahah"
29051,8619232,2013-11-08,9565178,Jason,Edwin was freaking awesome. His place was nice and I felt very welcomed there. I would def stay at his place again. Great location too!
29051,8966336,2013-11-29,7336243,Doug,"Edwin's room was great—nice, cozy and clean—and he was very nice and friendly.

As some of the other reviews have noted, the room is right above a busy street and can be noisy. This didn't bother me at all, but if you're sensitive to nighttime noise, bring some earplugs."
29051,9183091,2013-12-11,9119117,Nir,"Edwin is great! I got really late and he was waiting for me. Also was very kind by doing my laundry :)
I definitely gonna visit Edwin again as he was easy going and a great host.

Location is around night life, restaurants, shopping mall and club. And thanks Edwin for allowing me early check in and late check out"

29051,10625889,2014-02-28,12378877,Gil,"Would definitely recommend! A clean, cute little place in the heart of Amsterdam. Although it definitely gets loud at night, the higher price was totally worth it! Edwin was a great host, too - there was slight mixup with my reservation and I surprised him somewhat, but he was a pro and figured it all out without a hitch! Also, if one shows up and Edwin is out, Alex the proprietor of the hair place next door is very friendly and will let you wait inside his place! If you're into the coffee shop scene, there is one literally below Edwin's, which you can't beat for convenience. "
29051,10962707,2014-03-15,10652872,Wolf,"very nice place to stay in amsterdam! in the very heart of the city, and edwin is a very nice host :) not to forget puki, the cat! can really recommend this place!"

29051,11226482,2014-03-25,12802626,Silva,Awesome place to stay! Perfect location and the room was very clean and nice. Yes it can get pretty loud at night but hey you not really looking to spend quiet weekend there :D Greetings from LT Edwin ;)
29051,11594477,2014-04-08,13159727,Marc,Habitación muy agradable y confortable situada en un lugar muy céntrico. Ideal si te gusta la vida nocturna. 
29051,11668708,2014-04-11,5582564,Katie,"Ah, Edwin is SO FRIENDLY! and so funny! Also his cat is the fluffiest ball of playfulness. The room was great, very cosy, and no more than 2 miles walk to all the things I wanted to go to (to go out, museums, etc). I had a great stay, recommended for sure."
29051,12004702,2014-04-21,13171978,Lisa Maria,"I had a wonderful time at Edwins place, which is right where the magic happens. There are bars and restaurants around the house and you can walk easily everywhere. "

29051,13076063,2014-05-19,829350,Hubert,"Edwin is a very gracious host.
He should have mentioned the cat in the building (I'm allergic). But he's keeping the place spotlessly clean - so I hadn't any problems at all."

The house is central to a lot of museums, the local traffic, the innercity, the daily flower market around the corner. 

Everything was great. Thank you for all your kindness, Edwin!"
29051,18901856,2014-09-02,19728169,Dror,"Best vacation ever! Edwin is the nicest man alive. Helpful, friendly, fun and funny. too bad I couldn't spent more time with him...
 The room was big and inviting (comfortable single room), clean and warm. And you simply can't beat the location. 
There are pubs all along the street, and they are full every night. 
Awesome! I'll definitely come back"
29051,19157814,2014-09-07,19496543,Vikas,"'The' spot to be. It's the most centrally located house with bars & coffee shops just below. In very close walking distance of all the hot spots like Rembrandt Square, Leidse Square and 5 minutes by tram to Central station, Dam Square & Jordaan. Can't get better in terms of location. On top of that, Edwin is an ever smiling & extremely sweet and warm host who made me feel very comfortable during my stay. "
29051,19745450,2014-09-17,19989061,Dara,"Edwin's guesthouse is perfect for anyone visiting Amsterdam!  Everything was exactly as described, Edwin was extremely hospitable and his cat was delightful! The room was clean and the location was more than perfect just steps from the flower market. I recommend Edwin's guesthouse to anyone looking for a quick stay in Amsterdam!"

29051,20650906,2014-10-03,4396721,Caroline (Jingjing),"Edwin is a very fun and easy going host, we've had nice chitchats, and he's kindly helped to look after my suitcase during my trip to Giethoorn.

The apartment locates at the central downtown area, very close to the flower market on the river, which means walking distance to the canals and many attractions in town. The room is clean and comfortable, with everything needed for single travelers who would spend most of the time exploring the city. 

If you're a light sleeper, it could be a bit busy outside at night - there's pubs on the same street, but ear bugs would certainly solve the problem. 

Visit Edwin if you'll be in Amsterdam, and have fun!


"
29051,20758411,2014-10-05,4536531,Aprillya,"This is my first time to Amsterdam and using airbnb service.
Edwin was replying my e-mail very fast and answer to my questions.

I arrived with a huge heavy suitcase and Thank God... Edwin was very kind to help and brought it to the room at 3rd floor :D
Sorry for the trouble Edwin, I'm such a newbie with travelling issue ;)

The location: perfect!! right in the middle to everywhere.
A bit noisy after 01:00 am as there are several bars nearby; but it was nothing, compare to the perfect location. 
I can easily walk to Dam area, Museums, Shops, Indonesian restaurants, etc.

Sorry I was a bith hurry when leaving your place.
Hope to see you again in my next visit to Amsterdam.

Thanks."
29051,20910735,2014-10-07,20920836,Bodil,"Min vært fik mig i høj grad til at føle mig velkommen, han var venlig, afslappet og hjælpsom. Huset, værelset og det fælles badeværelse er ikke den vilde luksus, men det fungerer, hvis man ikke er meget krævende. Til gengæld bor man midt i hvor det hele sker i byen, dejligt, men også meget støjende på weekendaftener og nætter"
29051,21405733,2014-10-16,22338876,Han,very well
29051,21483026,2014-10-18,17771052,Eric,Edwin was a great host. He was very helpful giving directions on how to get to the apartment and when I got there made me feel completely at home. He also gave me great recommendations on food and different sight seeing and tourist attractions. The location of the apartment is great too. Can be a little noisy at night but I had no problem falling asleep. I would definitely stay here again.
29051,21789443,2014-10-24,3816954,Guillermo,"great location amidst a restaurant street and the flower market
walking distance from the city center, the dam and the museums
The room is very confortable and edwin does everything to make your stay easy
he even carried my heavy lugagge to the second floor!
keep in mind stairs are super narrow in these typical houses!
definitely recommend staying here "
29051,22190594,2014-11-01,16237655,Juliet,"I enjoyed my stay at Edwin's place a lot! The apartment is nice, clean and comfortable. I had a single room with a super comfortable queen bed, and the room had heating and was well-lit. The shared bathroom was really clean. Edwin is also the friendliest host -- really warm and welcoming, with lots of recommendations for things to do around town. Edwin was also super accommodating and let me drop off my luggage 1 day before I was staying at his place, because I was moving from a friend's place and going to take a full day trip on the day I was shifting to his house. My only comment is that the noise from the street gets pretty loud at night since it has lots of bars and restaurants, so that may affect light sleepers, but I didn't have any issues and slept super well during my time there. Thanks Edwin!"
29051,22399220,2014-11-05,16953310,Rachel,"Edwin was a great host! I felt very welcome in his home. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was nice as well. There were a lot of restaurants and shops, and it was walking distance from everywhere I could think to go. "

29051,23039341,2014-11-21,11880464,Laura,"Edwin was a very kind and caring host and at the same time really easy-going. I felt immediately at home and you get to stay at a real Amsterdam style house in a beautifully and colorful decorated room. The location is very central, close to the canal and with a bike rental just a few hundred meters down the road. I would definitely recommend Edwin's place and hopefully come back soon. "
29051,23146925,2014-11-24,14668979,Charin,Perfect location. Very close to everything.

29051,24197225,2014-12-22,9181840,Lucie,"Edwin's guesthouse was wonderful, very cosy and beautifully decorated, a real hidden gem. The guesthouse is on a very busy street with a lot of bars and nightclubs so noise is to be expected but the location was absolutely ideal, super Central and close to everything with trams also to help you get around. And Edwin was an absolutely fantastic host I hope to come and see him again! ;)"
29051,24899833,2015-01-03,25330430,Aden,"Edwin was an excellent host. Very accommodating. Always available for special needs, tips, advice on the city, etc. He's also very nice in all aspects.  The room was exactly as described. Very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was very clean too. Location was excellent if you like nightlife right outside the door. I highly recommend Edwin's guesthouse. "
29051,25497629,2015-01-18,256912,Richard,"Edwin is the perfect host, and Pookie, his cat, is the perfect co-host.  The location is convenient, the room is beautiful, comfortable and cozy.  Pookie even spent some time keeping me company.  

My only caution is that because it is such a convenient location, the nightlife just below the window can be boisterous well in to the early morning weekend hours.  If you are in Amsterdam to party, this is the place.  If you are needing some rest, it can be a bit noisy.

I hope to be back at Edwin's place soon!

That said, "
29051,25729437,2015-01-24,26334858,Adam,Edwin was extremely kind and welcoming.  He told me about good neighborhood eats and even provided me w an electronic adapter since I had forgot to pack mine. Also...awesome neighborhood and location!! Central station a 15 min walk. The guest house is next to the iconic flower market (easy to find on a map/ask for directions).  There's a torus and tickets shop (the guys who sell hop on hop off bus) down the street if you want to by tickets for tours/attractions. Everything is close and the price is great and Edwin is a wonderful host. Would highly recommend!! 
29051,25945887,2015-01-30,26421772,Patrick,"Edwin's place was perfectly located, close to all the attractions in Amsterdam. The room was spacious, cosy, warm and clean; everything a traveller wants!

Edwin was an absolutely fantastic host (my favourite host ever)!!! Super friendly and very fun and accommodating. Great for chatting to and hearing his stories. If you stay here, I definitely recommend getting to know Edwin if you get the chance!! He's a fantastic guy and a fantastic host and he really contributed to my positive experience of Amsterdam. :)"

It's super central, all locations you have to visit are really close cause you are right in the heart of amsterdam! It's just perfect. Edwin is a super host - friendly, sympathic and helpful even at nighttime :) It was a fantastic trip to amsterdam and there were no problems at all about the arrival/ check out or even the room, which was clean and friendly.

The guesthouse is in a wonderful position (near the famous Bloemenmarkt) very close to the centre and with lots of nice places to visit and enjoy at a walking distance.
Highly recommended!"
29051,28073529,2015-03-17,4037374,Huiting,Edwin was such a delightful and accommodating host! He was so helpful with my late arrival and made my stay very comfortable. The room was charming and the location hard to beat! The flower market was right around the corner and all the attractions were within a few minutes walk. This was a great trip and I hope to visit again someday!
29051,28237368,2015-03-20,6233790,Jesse,Edwin was at home to welcome me and gave plenty of information
29051,28494440,2015-03-24,8975549,Mariela,"Edwin is the most !! He received me very well at home, helped with my heavy suitcase ... he was very attentive! the room is beautiful, very spacious and with all amenities. the place was very well located in the heart of the city, with thousands of bars and places to walk ... would return to go!"
29051,29039907,2015-04-03,26900460,Gabriela,Edwin is a great host and a very nice person. The house is clean and quiet. In my room I also had a tv with dvds - so that I could also watch harry potter! :)
29051,29385991,2015-04-07,13471600,Colman,"Edwin de Vega is very personable and obliging, and his house is in a very central location, ideal for both sightseeing and socialising.  The room itself was spotless, and facilities included a DVD player and a small library of DVDs. The shared bathroom was also clean.

Earplugs were offered because of the general street noise. I'm a heavy sleeper so I was content to manage without them but noise was an occasional nuisance. Still, it's not like having a disco or rock band under your bedroom, which has been an experience of mine, and it's tolerable unless you're a light sleeper."
29051,29672489,2015-04-11,28364417,Riccardo,"Great Location!
Edwin is a great guy, available and he is able to provide great tips.

Location is a little to noise, bring some hear-plug to sleep.
I reccomended it and I would come back!"
29051,29905146,2015-04-14,9721432,Aditya,"The stay at Edwin's house was awesome. Neat and clean. Right in the middle of everything. Excellent communication. Don't think will find a better place than Edwin's in Amsterdam at this price. 
Just bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. 
Thanks, Edwin, for the wonderful stay. Cheers"
29051,30066470,2015-04-17,26321002,Clementine,"Very nice place, and very helpful host!
It's a wonderful location and the room was really nice with an arty feeling thanks to the lovely pictures on walls. Would definitely recommend this place in the heart ot amazing Amsterdam!"
29051,31656981,2015-05-08,31325037,Katherine,I had a very pleasant stay at Edwin's BNB. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and Edwin was most helpful. The position is central although it can be a bit noisy at times I would stay there again the next time I am in Amsterdam.
29051,32517701,2015-05-19,29598708,Lfer,"The room was great, clean and confortable, the wifi doesn't work well ! Great location ! "
29051,32817979,2015-05-22,29690589,Maria,"Edwin seems a very nice guy, he's definitely easy to talk to, and if you've got any questions, he answers within minutes. The room was clean and comfortable, the place is in the heart of the city, close to everything of interest, and it's easy to find. The only drawback is that it can be quite noisy at night, but hey, it's Amsterdam, baby!
Many thanks once again, Edwin!"
29051,32962337,2015-05-24,26960524,Luis,Edwin was a great host! Very nice and easy to talk to! The apartment is in a great location close to everything you want to see and do in Amsterdam! 
29051,33417040,2015-05-27,8766788,Kohei,I liked Edwin and Edwin's flat so much. The location is convenient and easy to walk to anywhere in the center of Amsterdam. The price is reasonable. The room is clean and comfortable. Edwin is very friendly and helpful. I forgot to bring a plug transformer for the EU. Edwin kindly found and lent it to me. I recommend this flat for all interested in visiting Amsterdam.
29051,33522482,2015-05-29,6661322,Mike,"I highly recommend staying with Edwin if you're in Amsterdam! He's incredibly warm and friendly, quick to respond to messages, and has a very comfortable space set up for guests - complete with maps and info about the area.
His space is located in a really accessible spot in Amsterdam, and I was able to walk almost everywhere I wanted to go."
29051,34518417,2015-06-09,5905699,Luciane,"I spent almost one week and it was amazing! The apartment is very comfortable and really well located – it is close to flowers market and Rembrandt square, with lots of options of transportation, restaurants and everything you need. Very easy to find.
In addition, Edwin is an excellent host, very attentive and funny.
"
29051,35452179,2015-06-19,7389920,Ken,"Overall a very positive experience. The description was very accurate. Edwin was very friendly and welcoming. The room was tidy and sufficiently spacious. Most importantly, the very central location (at the heart of the triangle of gallery district eg Rijksmusuem, the old town/ red light districts, and Rembrandt house/Jewish quarter) makes this the perfect place for visitors. The room was subject to street noise during the nights of weekends but I think it's a small trade off for its location. Would certainly stay at Edwin's again when I return to Amsterdam."
29051,36662760,2015-06-30,4497539,Benjamin,"This was my second time staying at Edwin's and it was great. If you value having a friendly, helpful and attentive host and want an authentic Dutch house to stay in then this is the place for you! It's the kind of experience which typifies everything that is good about Airbnb. I visit Amsterdam frequently and I'll definitely be booking in to stay at Edwin's again for sure. "
29051,36864978,2015-07-02,18722727,Sarah,"My first experience in Europe was staying at Edwins in Amsterdam. As soon as I walked up to the door, I knew this was a prime location and as soon as I knocked on the door, Edwin was there to greet me! It was great to have such a friendly person answer the door after 10+ hours of traveling! The listing description was absolutely accurate and exactly what I was looking for. If I were to go back to Amsterdam I would 100% stay here as it was great location to restaurants, shopping and close to everything. The only thing is... I wish I stayed longer! Thanks Edwin for a great stay! "
29051,37053767,2015-07-04,32942377,Clive,"I was made welcome the minute I stepped through the door with a nice cold beer on a very hot day. Edwin was a great host and I would definitely stay again if I return to Amsterdam. Room was clean and airy with adjoining bathroom and was situated by the flower market within walking distance of many attractions, restaurants, coffee shops and bars. "
29051,37563387,2015-07-08,31234335,Jessie,I had a wonderful time at Edwin's! The room and location were perfect. A great way to spend my first visit to Amsterdam. Easy walking distance to almost everything. So quaint and perfect. :)
29051,39154745,2015-07-21,30952199,Jordi,Great room in a very busy and central location. The room was very clean and the toilet in perfect condition. 
29051,39395661,2015-07-23,32160716,Miriam,"Súper!!! Totalmente recomendado! El cuarto es muy cómodo, me sentí como en casa. Llegué antes de la hora de check-in y Edwin me dejó quedarme desde que llegué. La ubicación es padrísima ya que a unos cuantos pasos está el mercado de las flores, muchas tiendas de recuerdos, y está a una cuadra del tranvía. "
29051,39602298,2015-07-25,1904876,Megan,"Edwin was very welcoming and communicated very well. 

The place is perfectly located by the flower market and a tram line. It is so easy to get around from this location and there are always people around, so it feels very safe. 

The room was nice and had windows overlooking the street, which was nice. The bathroom is shared with other Airbnb renters, which was never a problem and actually made me feel more comfortable as a lone traveler. The staircase is somewhat steep and winds up, but is typical for Amsterdam. 

The home and street are so charming--the perfect stay for me. "
29051,39922059,2015-07-27,27453652,Yi Heen,The room that Edwin provided was really great. It looked better in real life than in the photos. There was really nothing that could have been done better! Great location and great room
29051,40568177,2015-08-01,30744807,Denise,I stayed for four nights at Edwin's place. It was a great experience. Central to everything and Edwin was really helpful with any questions I had about the city. I loved the experience of staying in a building that had lots of history with the big windows overlooking a  main street. The place had everything I needed....even morning coffee and the most adorable cat! Thank you again Edwin.
29051,41756801,2015-08-09,10478810,Sky,"Fantastic room to stay in, very centrally located.  Edwin is a great host, gave me some great suggestions on where to go when asked.  Hard to recommend it more!"
29051,42660007,2015-08-15,11559932,Rob,"Edwin was a warm and friendly host.  He was a little stressed when I arrived because his washing machine had died and he was under the hammer, but we had a pleasant interaction.  The location was incredibly central and easy to get anywhere.  The disadvantage was the level of noise at night which went until 5am each night as revellers poured out of the bars down the road.  The bathroom was adequate though for sharing between 4 rooms it was pretty tiny."
29051,44104943,2015-08-24,17844547,Renee,"The room is very clean, Edwin is an excellent host. It's in an great location, if you wanted to you could walk all the way from Centraal station, it's maybe a 25 minute walk that goes through a very touristy area that is always safe and full of people. I felt very comfortable with the room and general location. "
29051,44761765,2015-08-29,30559825,Fernando,"The place is very well located. I was very nicely received when I arrived.
The room was great, clean and with a bathroom behind.
Many thanks to everything!
The only thing that I disliked, but it's not the host's fault, is that at the street there are many bars and there is too much noise late at night. People drunked and talking loud. But knowing how to deal with it, it's ok. Great place."
29051,45081591,2015-08-31,8766027,Habib,"Edwin was really nice ! He has a warm smile and everything went very smoothly :) He was very flexible with my checkout as well, which was very nice of him.
The bedroom is very cute, and the location was PERFECT. 
if you want  to stay in the center i definitely recommend this room "
29051,45551292,2015-09-04,20508042,Mark,"Edwin. Edwin. where do I begin.... Edwin's guesthouse is amazing... the place is very central, close to everything. didn't need to buy public transport ticket because it's so close to everywhere. Edwin told me what bus to take and where to go to reach the place. Edwin's house is an old school Dutch house with skinny spiral stairs. it wasn't too bad of a stairs. the room is a queen size bed // double bed. it is very spacious. there's a TV with DVDs ( if you decide to stay in watch tv in Amsterdam!!!). although the place is loud at night, you must understand that this place is in central Amsterdam where party goes anytime of the dam. 

Edwin is the bomb. he took me all over town and even got me to do haircut! best hostess, ahem, host yet!!!! "
29051,46123426,2015-09-08,32023096,Brady,"Edwin was a great host. Very friendly and helpful with suggestions. He even let me borrow his umbrella on a particularly rainy day. The room was as described. Great location and very central to town. However, the street has several clubs on it, so it could be a little noisy at night. I am a deep sleeper and had no problems "
29051,48062604,2015-09-23,33441190,Mireille,"Well located, Edwin was nice and his cat was adorable. Easy to communicate with him. Good size room, decent bathroom. I would recommend!"
29051,48303040,2015-09-25,41762975,Toni,"The directions from the airport were easy and the location in town was wonderful for getting around Amsterdam. Edwin was a great host, helping with directions and suggesting places to eat. I wish I had more time to spend on my trip and look forward to returning."
29051,49325992,2015-10-03,39724580,Paul,"I very much enjoyed my stay. You can't beat the location if you want to really experience Amsterdam, and Edwin was so helpful.  Even though he was out of the country himself, he made arrangements for someone to meet me immediately. I will definitely come back again."
29051,49598069,2015-10-05,6686943,Jean Marcel,quartier très animé - chambre au second étage d'une vieille maison - plutôt sympa et propre
29051,50619595,2015-10-13,37319207,Timo,"I stayed four nights at Edwin's single bedroom and had a great time. He's a very friendly and helpful guy. I didn't need any public transportation because the location of his place is so central, you can reach everything by walking.

There are a couple of bars in the same street, so it is kind of noisy at night. I didn't really mind tho, I just went to bed later than most people ^^"
29051,51262961,2015-10-19,5760482,Chi Kan Sammy,"Edwin is a very nice host. Thanks to his house's central location, you can reach many major sights within walking distance. As pointed out in previous reviews, it can get pretty noisy at night, so it might not be so suitable for people looking for a quiet night's sleep. Apart from this, it was a great experience staying in Edwin's house!"
29051,51625063,2015-10-22,43852553,Jennifer,"Had a great stay at Edwin's! He was a very accommodating host - as I had some complications with my timing for checking in and he was very understanding! Room was perfect, comfortable and clean. It was noisy at night but I was aware of that from the posting and previous reviews so was not bothered by it in the least. Fantastic location in the heart of one of the most beautiful cities I've ever seen! :)"
29051,51784781,2015-10-24,8387549,Víctor,"Una habitación perfecta en el centro de Amsterdam ideal para pasar un par de días. La habitación es cómoda y muy bien decorada. Lo único, al ser tan céntrico y estar ubicado en una zona peatonal con mucho ocio nocturno por las noches se oye bastante el jaleo de la fiesta."
29051,52101588,2015-10-26,3671555,Philipp,"Thanx again, Edwin, you were really welcoming and helpful, wouldnt really know if there is anything you should change, really. Just keep it up! Stay who you are.
Place is also nice and clean, no complaints here either. And really close to... everything :) [sure, street below is crowded on weekends; for me that was not a problem at all]"
29051,52317296,2015-10-28,39897357,Barbara,"Edwin's room was a very nice place to stay in the very center of Amsterdam. There is a supermarket nearby and several bars, restaurants, shops etc. The staircases are very steep, a typical Amsterdam staircase, so take a small luggage ;) "
29051,52518646,2015-10-30,14445941,Jorge,"My stay was peaceful. The best way to get there is by Tram, if you arrive at the central station. The house is easy to find. It's in a good area to explore the city, because the guest house is very central and easily accessible. Edwin received me well, and was always available to help. Room was perfect, comfortable and clean. Surely I will come back to use this guest house again! I recommend!

- I found that there closely, there are direct buses to Schiphol airport. The stop is about 10 minutes walk from the guest house. Follow towards the Leidseplein, the stop is in front of the American Hotel. Start at 5am, from 15 to 15 minutes - € 5"
29051,52966722,2015-11-03,12810868,Nicholas,A lovely room for a solo traveler or couple with a very friendly and accomodating host.
29051,53461349,2015-11-09,22894148,Annabell,"Edwin was a wonderful host and made me feel very welcome! The guesthouse is in a great part of Amsterdam with great access to public transport and many stores and cafes right when you step out the door. The room was very clean and lovely. The Wifi was sometimes a bit flaky and I had trouble connecting but altogether it was okay. What I didn't realize is that the guesthouse is in a part of town where people like to party until 3am and they start cleaning the street at 7/8am, which unfortunately made it hard to sleep because it was very loud. If I'm going to Amsterdam for pleasure and not for business (where I need sleep) I would definitely stay with Edwin again :)"
29051,53678191,2015-11-11,22886401,Glen,"Edwin was very friendly and accommodating. The place is very chill, lots of natural light with plenty of space for a single room. It can be a little noisy at night, but there are no cars, so the conversations are quite peaceful, really."
29051,54361161,2015-11-18,24754904,Nina (Annie),The host canceled this reservation 82 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
29051,54982381,2015-11-27,22961272,Costanza,"I couldn't enjoy Edwin hospitality because it was a gift for my friend Edoardo. He stayed at Edwin's house for two nights and really enjoyed the room, the house and his cat. The neighbourhood is very nice and really in the centre of the city.
Recommended!"
29051,55246330,2015-11-29,45206625,Rj,"Edwin's place was great! it is very much in the center and very accessible to anywhere. Edwin helped me get settled and made me feel very much at home. His personality is great and very welcoming and we easily clicked!

"
29051,55464961,2015-12-01,42370970,Capucine,"The communication with Edwin was good and upon arrival I was welcomed by Edwin and his very friendly cat ^^
The room was absolutely adorable and very comfortable, in a typical old house. It's a very pleasant place to relax when it's raining outside. Not so noisy during the weekend, considering the fact that it looks over a very lively street. The house is just near the flower market and the old town, which was just magical. Overall it was a great experience."
29051,55608661,2015-12-03,42597165,Ying,"I am 155 cm petite Chinese girl and I arrived in a light rainy afternoon, definitely had some unpleasant experience with Edwin. I traveled 8 countries with 6 hosts. Edwin is the only one refuse to help me with my 22 inch luggage.  He said he cannot wet himself while letting me staying in the rain and he said he is not suppose to help. I almost called airbnb Bc I cannot reach my room. His attitude was really bad. When I left, I asked the guy in the room next to mine to make my luggage to the door. Apt is extremely old. This is the only unpleasant stay I had with airbnb. "
29051,55808278,2015-12-06,39986210,婧妍,"I have spent wonderful days at Edwin's house. The room is really beautiful and he's really an artist. I can find anything that I need in the room and I was welcomed also by his friendly cat. 
The house is well located in the city center, closely to all the interests. There's a street full of restaurants and bars so at night it'll be a little bit noisy. But it's okey. 
Edwin's really nice and I recommend to all his lovely guest house. "
29051,56049485,2015-12-08,992781,Sorin,"perfect location, close to everything, clean and the host super nice and flexible :0) "
29051,56619412,2015-12-15,4173897,Thomas,"Very nice stay. The guesthouse is very well located. The room is clean with view on the street. The area is a bit noisy but it's perfectly fine and makes the charm of the place. 
And above all, Edwin is an amazing host who takes care of his guesthouse and his guests :)"
29051,56726878,2015-12-17,47961363,Patricia,The location of the apartment is probably the best part as you are always walking distance to everything you need! The room itself looked exactly like the pictures with a great view on the street. Edwin was extremely nice and caring! 
29051,56912936,2015-12-20,3372519,Bridie,"It was an absolute joy to stay at Edwin's! 

Edwin is a fantastic host, great communication and extremely helpful. He went over and above for me on two occasions, which were much appreciated and made my stay all the more pleasant. 

The accommodation was perfect, as described, in a brilliant location, clean and comfortable. There is a shared bathroom, which was communicated and totally fine, no issues for me, but something to be aware of.

Transport to and from airport couldn't be easier with train and tram, the tram stop is metres from the house, so handy! Would absolutely stay again next time I'm in Amsterdam, thanks Edwin!"
29051,57128800,2015-12-22,19160743,Ned,Edwin was a gracious and communicative host. I would recommend staying with him. Great location. 
29051,57750050,2015-12-29,1910664,Lior,"Edwin is a very nice person, who helps in any way he can. He is friendly and works hard to provide for the best accommodation possible,
Thanks to Edwin"
29051,58998388,2016-01-05,39966802,Paula,The location is very good ! And Edwin is a very nice person . Helped a lot !!! Hope come back again 
29051,59484457,2016-01-11,49302587,Connor,"My stay was great! The room is nice and its in a good location. Also, Edwin is friendly and helpful"
29051,59896988,2016-01-17,14385706,Pablo,"Edwin was a great host. The place is well located, there is easy access to the most important places in the city. The room was warm and cozy. It gets a bit noisy at night because of the surrounding restaurants and pubs. I really enjoyed my stay and I'd love to go back."
29051,60471091,2016-01-24,49361438,Breandan,A perfect location in Amsterdam. Close to all points of interest. Edwin was a very nice and helpful host. I definitely recommend this listing for those visiting Amsterdam.
29051,60769609,2016-01-27,42844877,Fred,"Great host, great location, cozy and definitely a bargain for the money. Edwin was helpful, welcoming and was always there if you needed him. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam. Location is superb."
29051,60906569,2016-01-29,16807432,Spencer,The room is excellent. The location is perfect. Edwin is a really nice and friendly person! I will definitely look into staying here again next time I am in Amsterdam.
29051,61151690,2016-02-01,15212907,Lenka,It was my third stay at Edwins place. Everything was just perfect. Thank you Edwin for making my stay fabulous!
29051,61514109,2016-02-05,43735811,Yongliang,"edwin是一个非常幽默的人,同时他也很热情,很周到｡提供的房间不大,但是很温馨,很好,非常喜欢"
29051,61694670,2016-02-07,39269881,Franziska,"Very charming guesthouse located right in the city center with a great host. Thank you for everything, Edwin!"
29051,63064063,2016-02-20,44441486,Janel,"It was my very first time traveling internationally so the train/tram system can feel overwhelming to a newbie from the US (especially on the west coast where our public transportation isn't as in depth) but Edwin made me feel very confident on how to navigate from Schipol to his place, even tells you how much you can expect to pay on taxi or train & tram. Once I got to the street I was just looking for the address & he was already expecting me because he opened the door and called out my name, now that's a host who you know has your back! The house has a very narrow, winding staircase & I had a huge heavy suitcase with me but Edwin just picked it right up & helped me out so quickly. He is very friendly and a lot of fun, he will talk to you like you're an old friend which is really cool and makes you feel like you really are staying with a friend and not a complete stranger! Edwin was fantastic at greeting me whenever I left and whenever I came back, which was awesome :) otherwise, he pretty much stays out of the way completely and you only really see him when you're coming and going so it's just the perfect amount of host-guest interaction. You do share one bathroom & there are 2 other guest rooms so if you have to go then go before someone else gets to it first! ;) The street is VERY loud with drunk people at night & trucks/garbage in the morning & the window faces the street so I was very fortunate to have brought earplugs with me! I highly suggest it ;) it's completely worth it though because the location is perfect. You're next to everything! Edwin has a lot of ""repeat offenders"" and I believe he and his sweet, beautiful feline just made a new one out of me if I ever find myself back in Amsterdam, which of course! :)"
29051,63656775,2016-02-25,58846556,Katherine,"Edwin was a fantastic host, especially with directions to and from the airport. He asked about animal allergies and was very kind. Everything I needed was there and the location was outstanding, I walked everywhere I needed to go. "
29051,64300261,2016-03-02,55891043,Fabrice,"Edwin est très accueillant et disponible. La chambre était très propre et correspondait parfaitement au descriptif. Position centrale proche de tous les lieux touristiques.  Logement situé dans une zone avec de la vie nocturne donc assez bruyante, mais ceci est clairement indiqué dans le descriptif donc cela ne m'a ni surpris, ni dérangé.  "
29051,65050719,2016-03-10,8014870,Ariel,"Everything was perfect. The flat is clean, very well located and Edwin is a great host. There are places to eat, to walk around and to have fun. It is a great place to stay. I used a bike taxi to carry my luggage because the Amsterdam Centraal is about 10-15 min walking. Definitely 5 stars"
29051,65098829,2016-03-10,16586601,Rebekah,"Edwin was delightful - very friendly and informative and anticipated anything I might need. My room was very warm and comfortable, and the space has lots of thoughtful little touches. I highly recommend Edwin as a host, and really enjoyed chatting with him. "
29051,65518590,2016-03-15,30199204,Michael,"Edwin was a wonderful host! I got in a bit late on the first night, but he made sure I knew how to contact him so he could buzz me up and was happy to see how excited I was for the experience the room provided (with such a good view of a lively street, a clean space (including the bathroom), and a very comfortable bed, it was the perfect Amsterdam experience I was hoping for). He was always welcoming, warm, understanding, and never intrusive. I highly recommend Edwin's spaces, especially since the location is simply perfect (and the cafe downstairs is great in the mornings).

I miss Amsterdam already, thank you Edwin!"
29051,65638449,2016-03-16,59297751,아람,"It was my first try for using airb&b. Eventhough Edwin gave me a right direction, it took a lot to find. But the location was great so that I could go back home whenever I felt cold or tired. Warm & cozy room is there for you. Thanks Edwin"
29051,66043198,2016-03-19,55847027,Kevin,"I had a wonderful experience at Edwin's. His place is in a perfect location (right next to the Flower Market) and it was extremely easy to get anywhere in the city. The room itself is small with a bathroom directly next to the bedroom. If you are looking for a centrally located, clean and safe place to stay during your time in Amsterdam, I would highly recommend staying here."
29051,66836397,2016-03-25,61212582,Anne,"Edwin was a great host! The room for one person (which could easily be shared by two as well) is very comfortable. Of course - as to expect in a house in one of the smaller streets in Amsterdam - it is not huge, but definitely big enough to accommodate one person and fulfill all needs. Edwin even provided towels! The bathroom, which is shared with other guests, was always very clean.
The location itself is right by the flower market and you can easily walk to a lot of the sights or just wander through the canals. If you're not into walking the tram station close by brings you to a lot of other great places. With streets such as Spui and Spuistraat close by you are not only close to museums but also great restaurants and bars. At night it can be loud and the street lantern can shine into your room if you don't use the curtains (I didn't because I like waking up to sunlight), but if that doesn't bother you and you're not a light sleeper, traveling by yourself and willing to explore the city, this is a great location for you. I had a good time and would definitely recommend Edwin's place!"
29051,67257929,2016-03-27,12302330,Chenli,You will feel being taken care of a big brother in a very good way. Suuuuuper clean room with insanely comfortable bed. Untouched bathroom is beyond five star hotel. Unbelievable center location. What else will stop you from booking Edwin's room? Maybe no sleepover policy. Hahah. 
29051,68338510,2016-04-04,23400933,Beate,"It was better than the brief review on AirBnb. The host is just amazing: very charming and full of suggestions so you will find everything you are looking for in the city.
I will visit again. Thank you for a great time."
29051,68995512,2016-04-08,47538005,Siddhant,"It was my first trip to Amsterdam and for a short duration, so I was looking for a room that is close to city center. And I found Edwin's home suitable as per my requirement. 

Located in a prime location, every major tourist destination is close by. The Tram station is 100 steps away and 15mins walk from Amsterdam Central Station (if you prefer to walk). Edwin briefed me very well how about the routes from the Airport to the home.

The house is located in a street which has many eateries and pubs around making it a happening place. The room was cozy and on the first floor of the house. The only issue that I faced was, the noise coming from the road in the night. But I didn't mind it. 

There is a beautiful cat in the house, so if you are not a cat lover, you can inform Edwin beforehand and he will take care of it. 

Coming back to Edwin, he's a good host giving all the privacy you need. I am definitely going back to his place soon. "
29051,69418552,2016-04-11,53936816,Peter,"This was my first time to book and use AirBnB. I chose Edwin for the location, the great rate, and the positive reviews others have left. Even though i arrived late Edwin was there to greet me and bring me to my room while making me feel welcome to his home. The room i stayed in was perfectly setup, very clean, and exactly as described in Edwins posting. The room was overlooking the main street and the bed was comfortable. I got a good nights rest even though i could hear people out on the street it did not bother me to fall asleep. The bathroom and shower were clean and very well kept. Edwin offers coffee and tea whenever the desire hits you and the cafes to eat were right outside the door. Edwin spent time with me to talk about my visit and offered words of advice as i journeyed out to see Amsterdam. He even offered a great place to get a hair cut! Thanks for that Edwin. I would definitely stay again with Edwin when i visit Amsterdam again. I would highly recommend to anyone that Edwins house is the perfect place to stay and enjoy what Amsterdam has to offer. Everything i wanted to see was within walking distance of Edwins house and at the end of the day the house was a welcome sight."
29051,69833452,2016-04-14,45642508,Tim,"Edwin hat mich kurzfristig bei sich aufgenommen. Seine 3 Zimmer sind sehr gefragt, was ich nach meinem Aufenthalt sehr gut nachvollziehen kann. Die Räumlichkeiten sind schön! Das Bad ist sehr sauber und wird täglich gereinigt. Ich habe mich rundum wohlgefühlt. Für Fragen oder ein Gespräch ist Edwin immer zu haben. "
29051,70430374,2016-04-17,53721360,Nee,"Edwin was a fantastic host! He was very easy to talk to, on top of friendly and helpful when it came to the city. His place was clean and wonderfully located. I hope I can stay here again when I visit later in life."
29051,70935340,2016-04-22,52959795,Stuart,"The location is ideal just 25mins walk from the Amsterdam Central railway station. The room was good with all that was needed. Shared bathroom next door which was clean with all that was required.  Edwin welcomed me and showed me the room, explained that tea and coffee making facilities were available and explained the single house rule - don't let the cat out!

The road has lots of restaurants on it as well as a noisy bar. If, like me, you prefer an early night then take your earplugs."
29051,71768808,2016-04-28,50916411,Natalia,"Hello Edwin.
Thank you so much for hospitality. Everything was just so cool :)
hope to come back end enjoy to stay in your beautiful, cosy house.

Regards,
Natalia from Ukraine "
29051,72222590,2016-05-01,4385115,David,"Room was perfect. Edwin was informative and charming. The WiFi was spotty at times, both networks, but the restaurant across the street had a good signal even from the house. Great location and close to trains and buses. Within 20 mins walk of all attractions. "
29051,72562107,2016-05-03,17905681,Vera,"I had a lovely stay At Edwin's place.  Its a fabulous traditional old Amsterdam house in a great location.  Comfortable clean room and bed, and nice host and decent WiFi. Easy to walk everywhere in the town from here. 

Thank you for letting me stay in your gorgeous house Edwin. I will be back!"
29051,72854569,2016-05-05,39033972,LuAnn,Edwin was very good host.  He has excellent communication skills and makes a guest feel welcome.
29051,74260669,2016-05-14,56579644,Николай,"Host was awesome. Nice comfortable room near tram stop that can get you anywhere and supermarket right around corner.

Awesome place to stay.

P.S. Hair dryer will not work in weak current socket in shower room, take it to your room and use there.

P.P.S. There is Heineken bar(or smth like that) nearby that gets rowdy from 10pm to 2am so plan your sleep schedule accordingly."
29051,75044977,2016-05-18,47482811,Nick,Edwin was so nice and helpful (he even helped me carry all of my 70 lb luggage up two flights of stairs that I was bringing from university). The room was really nice and I felt right at home in Amsrerdam thanks to him and his hospitality!
29051,75779560,2016-05-23,47882278,Lawrence,"The description fits the room as Edwin states, the room Is perfectly fitted in the middle of the city to all the destinations you will need. I was able to experience everything I needed from the perfect location and Edwin was a perfect host and kept the building clean and in order and even provides a towel for the shower and info on the city. The bars are literally 10 minutes away and then opera house is about 15 minute walk as well along with rijksmuesm. I would definitely come back!"
29051,77240359,2016-05-30,12940414,Sally,"Edwin is a delightful host: considerate, friendly while still respecting his guests' privacy, patient with my scattiness and completely trustworthy. His 1642 house has charm and all the modern conveniences you want. Countless restaurants immediately outside and close to just about everything you'd want to see in Amsterdam.  And his cat is a beauty."
29051,77578214,2016-06-01,11102067,Jeffrey,"This place was perfect for a few days in Amsterdam. I didn't have too much interaction with Edwin, but when I did, he was helpful, friendly and easy-going. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a fabulous deal in the center of the city."
29051,78456213,2016-06-06,10743208,Nessie,"Edwin is a jewel! He was bright, cheerful and friendly. He even planned with my boyfriend so a surprise package would arrive for me. Although the washroom is shared, it is cleaned every morning around 6am and is stocked with shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The room is very spacious and clean. Edwin also did my laundry. Lastly, it is in the perfect location which means no tram (little) or buses which saves the EUROS. When I go back to Amsterdam, I am going to stay with him again! Can't recommend him enough. "
29051,79673697,2016-06-13,39497387,Zeynep,"This house is all you need for Amsterdam! It is located in the center and you can go anywhere you want, from the most visited places to your special preferences. My room was also really good, I liked eveything about it. And Edwin, what an amazing person he is! Thanks for helping me, telling everything i needed to know about the city and specially I enjoyed all our funny chats! Thank you! "
29051,80194997,2016-06-16,61572729,Elio,"Edwin was a super nice host, made me feel very welcome. Everything was super clean and tidy, the room was perfect, the bed was soft and the bathroom was nice too.
Edwin also gave me directions to find a couple of things I needed and was always available to talk.
The place is perfectly located in the middle of everything; it's half way of everthing so I was able to walk to every place.
And Edwin, I'll always dearly remember your umbrella and when you told me ""take it, take it"" with a smile. It was a life saver and helped me in more ways than I expected "
29051,80515604,2016-06-18,7453407,Ricky,"Edwin is the funnies host i have ever met since i started to use airbnb services. you know what, friendliness, hospitality and kindness is way too little to describe him as a host.

if you wanna explore the true essence of amsterdam, his place is always your first choice.

located in the heart of the city and it only takes 4 stops to get to his place by tram.

highly recommended!"
29051,81689894,2016-06-24,46251009,Amos,"Edwin was able to meet me at my arrival time, even though i arrived late.

He was really friendly and hospitable, and made me feel at home.

Would recommend!!"
29051,82639580,2016-06-28,3307427,Sue,"Edwin is a great host, since my flight got delayed I wasn't able to get there at the given time. He was there waiting for me, very welcoming and frindly. The place is just what I needed for a few days. It was clean and cozy. He dedicated a little bit of his time to   me in a map how to get around Amsterdam. At night, there is a few bars downstairs and it can get noisy but with some hearos extreme protection earplugs I solved the problem. The area is friendly and safe! I would stay at Edwin's guest house if I return to Amsterdam. "
29051,84345073,2016-07-06,52271407,Kathryn,I had a lovely stay at Edwin's house. The room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was cosy and comfortable. Great atmosphere. Edwin was so lovely and friendly. He is also full of advice if you need any about Amsterdam. He was very helpful when I first arrived helping me with my suitcase upstairs. Great location. Highly recommended. 
29051,84781928,2016-07-09,16344368,Hannah,"Edwin was a fantastic host. He made me feel at home right away. His home has a nice and warm atmosphere. Edwin was always available for help. The room was very clean, cosy and right in the city centre.  I would certainly return here!"
29051,85429865,2016-07-11,25813738,Petra,Die Schlüsselübergabe hat perfekt geklappt. Alles war saube (Website hidden by Airbnb) und ordentlich. Ein schönes  Zimmer zum Übernachten in einer lebhaften Umgebung im Zentrum.
29051,86128256,2016-07-15,71766666,Kathryn,"Edwin was such a lovely host, directions to his place was very simple to follow, and the room itself was very nice and comfortable. Edwin was very accommodating and made my stay in Amsterdam even more wonderful!"
29051,86795714,2016-07-17,63199337,Darren,Edwin is a very friendly and helpful host. The room was comfortable and cozy and the location is fantastic. Right in the heart of town you are extremely close to everything. There are bars and restaurants right outside your door. Only downside is it can get noisy at night but you expect that given the location and it is a small price to pay. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience Amsterdam.
29051,87790705,2016-07-21,56334601,Michael,"Edwin was a caring and great host! Location is fantastic and the room fit my needs perfectly.  If I come back to Amsterdam,  I will look to stay at Edwin's."
29051,88552983,2016-07-24,35864460,Christian,"Sehr guter Platz, etwas laut, aber man ist müde von der tollen Stadt und schläft sofort hinweg. Sehr netter Gastgeber, unkompliziert, zuvorkommend. Bestens zu empfehlen!
Christian"
29051,89146350,2016-07-27,68758559,Rob,Clean room in a very central location. it can get a bit loud in the evenings but you're in Amsterdam. that's how it goes. would stay again. thanks Edwin.
29051,89930391,2016-07-30,54731229,Shaun,"The house and it's location are great: midway between the cultural and the crass attractions in beautiful Amsterdam.
The street gets few vehicles, but lots of non-rowdy people.
Very easy walking to all the city's attractions, shopping, and if you can't find something you want to eat nearby, you just ain't hungry!"
29051,92483403,2016-08-08,55145917,Sonia,"In EVERY Way, EDWIN made me feel WELCOMED. HE took me shopping to a Great Plaza with great prices, which I LOVED!
Was Very understanding  when I showed up 1 day EARLY for my reservation. I'll stay there again in a heartbeat & recommend  him wholeheartedly. 
He Helped me with directions & ANY questions  I had. 
GREAT location & close to everything."
29051,92926300,2016-08-10,25180873,Joao,"I had a great stay at Edwin's. The room was cosy and the location is perfect, just near the flower market right in the center of Amsterdam. It can get a little noisy at night because it's located in a street with bars, but it's not hard to get used to. And Edwin is a very nice and helpful host. So thumbs up to this place."
29051,94627376,2016-08-16,23240801,Ruben Kristoffer,"Edwin was very thorough with his instructions, I manage to arrive at his home with issues. His place was perfect for my short stay in Amsterdam. Very near the tram station and is a walking distance to popular tourist attractions. Will definitely recommend his place for solo travellers."
29051,95231775,2016-08-18,32719789,Ahmad,"This is a great listing. The house is located on a street with a lot of restaurants and bars so you can get your fill of what ever you like and stumble a couple of steps back to the room. 

Edwin was gracious and helpful. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. the Bathroom was shared with 3 other guests when the other listings are filled up. the room I was in had a queen bed. 

The only thing is like I said the room over looks a street full with bars so it can get loud at night."
29051,95809620,2016-08-21,8699285,Dinara,"Edwin is a great host, he takes care his guests and has an amazing sense of humor. Thank you very much for hosting me!!"
29051,98866202,2016-09-02,92147468,Christopher,I really loved this room right in the middle of Amsterdam. It allowed me so much freedom to be able to come and go and make it my base of operations while I was in the city.  The room was certainly very clean and tidy and nicely decorated.  The most wonderful thing about the room is the window which gives a great view to the alley and once the windows are shut there is not much noise.  This was my first time using Airbnb and after this experience I will surely use it agai.
29051,99404257,2016-09-04,64724971,Mus,Heb twee dagen heerlijk van Amsterdam genoten! De kamer is superknus en Edwin een super aardige gastheer!

29051,104483850,2016-09-26,673339,Brent,"I Booked Edwin's place for my son, who enjoyed his stay very much! Edwin was very easy to communicate with and went out of his way to answer questions about Amsterdam. I would be very comfortable and secure in recommending Edwin's place to anyone."

29051,106061144,2016-10-04,73332574,Lynn,"Edwin is such a sweet, friendly and funny man! I was lost the moment I landed with 2 luggage and Edwin was 100% responsive telling me what to do and where to go. He helped me carry my luggage up to my room as well. I felt absolutely at home and safe living at his place - Right in the heart of Amsterdam with plenty of good bars, food and shopping nearby. 

The bathroom is right next to the room. Everything was clean and bed was very comfy. One thing to note is that Edwin's place is right above a ton of bars and restaurants. It can get very noisy during the evening until early morning. I had no problems with this at all because I sleep quite late with music on. If you're a light sleeper - you should take note of this! 

His cute cat Pookie is adorable and very quiet. I didn't know he had a cat at first! No problems with that at all :) 

THANK YOU EDWIN FOR EVERYTHING! Stay gorgeous and if I'm ever back in Amsterdam, I will absolutely stay at yours again for sure! xx "

La habitacion es super comoda y esta muy bien preparada y decorada. Fueron unos gratos dias en Amsterdam a pesar de haber estado engripado."

방도 아늑하고 깨끗하고 정말 좋았습니다. "

29051,110605613,2016-10-27,49724670,Jayson,Edwin's room is perfect for a visit to Amsterdam. It is centrally located and close to a tram line if you're going further out. 
29051,112125363,2016-11-04,60738276,John,First of all...If Edwin is not fully booked and you can her accommodations with him your are lucky...Great spot....his home has got a warm feeling too it...Edwin is a great guy and a great host...his location is dead in the middle of Amsterdam making it ideal for exporing the city...right outside his house are many restaurants something for everyone.
29051,112678820,2016-11-06,74129384,Lx,"Top Unterkunft mitten in der Stadt!
Sauber-günstig-zentral.
Edwin ist sehr zuverlässig, extrem hilfsbereit und super freundlich.
Alles zur besten Zufriedenheit.
"
29051,112856955,2016-11-08,99684345,David,"He was very accommodating with everything, very flexible and willing to help however possible."
29051,113850912,2016-11-14,50069185,Cliff,Edwin was warm welcoming and sent me amazing directions to get to the house. Room was central to everything and it was comfortable. 
29051,115274885,2016-11-23,20653736,Kathryn,Great location! Could walk to everything. Slightly loud but I brought noise cancelling headphones and didn't bother my sleep at all.
29051,116583551,2016-12-01,65925524,Alejandra,"My stay at Edwin's was amazing. The room was very comfortable and spacious. The bathroom is right next to the bedroom and is shared with the 3 other guests. I had no issues sharing it and the bathroom is always clean. The set up of the bedrooms is in a way that allows privacy and it is also fun interacting with other guests, I made new friends. The area is also very very fun! There are clubs, bars and restaurants as soon as you walk out of the door. It can get loud on the weekends but me, personally, I like it and enjoy it. You will feel the itch to be out having fun. If you need some peace to sleep just take some earplugs. EVERYTHING was walking distance or easier access by public transport. The tram station is just a few blocks away. It was a great experience and you feel part of the neighborhood and Dutch lifestyle. I'm looking forward to go back and I'll definitely book Edwin's place if available. My only suggestion to the traveler is don't make my mistake and take a large suitcase. Edwin was super nice and helped me with my luggage. I forgot many European homes have small/tight stairs. Take two small ones if you need to :). And also I felt very very safe walking around everywhere and at home. As a female solo traveler my entire family was concerned but the area is very nice and safe :). "
29051,120005819,2016-12-06,37052754,Wesley,"Edwin was great! For the price and the location, I couldn't have asked for a better experience for my first trip to Amsterdam. I loved that he had a cat, too. The location is a great place to be if you like the nightlife in Amsterdam, as its right out your window. While this can make sleeping on the weekends a little challenging, I ended up just going out and enjoying myself so it wasn't a problem. I would absolutely recommend Edwin's place to anyone!"
29051,120159545,2016-12-08,69493625,Adrien,"Cute little room in the absolute middle of everything. I walked everywhere I needed to go from there. It's also close to a multitude of shops, cafés and restaurants that were fantastic to discover. "
29051,120398453,2016-12-10,26085302,Hannah,"What can I say about Edwin and his apartment?? The location couldn't be much better. In the heart of the gayborhood, right next to the flower market, across the canal from some great shopping, and tons of little restaurants. 
The stairs are a bit narrow (this is a canal house in Amsterdam so it's to be expected) and the street outside the apartment can be loud at times. Even though it didn't bother me, if you're a light sleeper you may want some ear plugs. Edwin was so kind as to carry my suitcase up (and back down!) the narrow stairs so it never even became an issue.
The bathroom is equipped with a well working shower and he even has provided a hair dryer for guest usage- perfect! Edwin also keeps out an array of teas and coffee for the guests in the small hallway between the rooms.
My stay was wonderful, the view of the street from my window was (for this American tourist) like another world, the location is ideal, and who can beat that rate?? If you have the option of snagging this gem while traveling in Amsterdam, don't wait- book it while you can!
Oh! Also, ask Edwin to see the cats. They're the cutest, sweetest, and friendliest little nuggets.

Thanks again, Edwin!"
29051,120872620,2016-12-12,22536881,Talmor,"Great host, offering a very comfy room right in the centre.

Edwin even typed up a nice note apologizing that he couldn't meet me because he was visiting his mother. Highly recommend :)

29051,128368959,2017-01-24,927207,Jewelyn,"Hey! Thanks Edwin for hosting me! First off Edwin replied quickly to my messages so communication was great! He gave me directions how to get to his flat with public transportation and waited for my arrival. Gave me a map and the keys to the room and main door. His cat is very friendly :) perfect location, I walked to everything! Lots of stairs to the room but that's typical. Thank you for helping me carry up my roller suitcase. You can hear the activity going on at night outside but I didn't mind because it was so central. Clean room and bathroom. Highly recommended. Thank you Edwin!! "
29051,129509462,2017-01-31,87975627,Kabir,"Very central, close to the 9 streets and the flower market is right out back. 
Edwin is really kind and helpful and he keeps the place clean.I would definately recommened this place to travellers looking to explore the city. "
29051,130065436,2017-02-04,30950945,Giacomo,"I stayed in this place for 5 days and I loved it. the position permitt to go almost anywhere on foot. In case tram station is really close. Edwin is a very kind person, totally dispo for any evenience! i hope to return here someday."
29051,132129862,2017-02-15,78433001,Jackson,An amazing place in an amazing part of town!  Edwin is an incredible host and if I ever go back to Amsterdam I will definitely be staying here again!
29051,132680608,2017-02-19,18502809,Jake,"Edwin is a great host and I loved the room I stayed in. Easy location for night-life and was simple to arrive from the airport. Bathrooms are shared but there's nice privacy, also the other renters there were nice as well. Will return!"
29051,133418209,2017-02-22,95915201,Grace,"Very central in a charming house, the room is perfect and Edwin is a really nice person. I recommend this place :)"
29051,135047980,2017-03-02,59201899,DaMom,"In booking my stay with Edwin, I read all the reviews available. I made my reservations based not only on these reviews but also knowing it was situated on a busy and noisy street surrounded by pubs and cafes. Living on a quiet farm, this is just what I wanted! I bought along ear plugs as suggested by some of the reviews but only used them one night because they were so uncomfortable. The rest of the nights, the lull of the noises actually helped me fall asleep."
29051,136223926,2017-03-09,1932478,Annie,"Highly recommend!! Edwin was very friendly, the location was perfect. Only thing I'd recommend is to bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper, as the location is near restaurants/bars so at time it could get a bit noisy."
29051,138737825,2017-03-21,110905776,Henry,Can't say enough about how wonderful of a host Edwin was. Really nice person. His place was easy to get to and extremely well maintained. I highly recommended this place to anyone looking to stay in Amsterdam. 5 stars all around. Thanks for having me Edwin.
29051,140652859,2017-03-31,98009819,Kate,"My stay with Edwin was so delightful! He was always available to answer any of my questions and was as kind as can be. As a solo female traveler, he made me feel immediately comfortable. If I go back to Amsterdam, I'll definitely stay there again!"
29051,142423379,2017-04-08,10298877,Erica,"Se todos os anfitriões fossem como o Edwin, tudo seria perfeito. Muito atencioso, me esperou na porta e carregou minha mala escada acima. O quarto era excelente, muito limpo, cama confortável e chuveiro muito bom.  O que não foi perfeito não foi por culpa do Ed. O bairro é extremamente barulhento à noite. Não dormi bem em nenhuma das noites que fiquei lá porque as pessoas ficam bebendo,  gritam e jogam garrafas na rua até umas 5 da manhã. Portanto, se você prezar pelo sono, melhor procurar outro lugar."
29051,143042080,2017-04-10,119857577,Jay,"I enjoyed my stay with Edwin's place. If you are a tourist and want to stay overnight in Amsterdam you will have a good, clean and safe place to stay. Just walking distance to most places. -"
29051,143501545,2017-04-12,69714543,Tara,"Solo female traveler: great for location! Bring ear plus or play music to sleep. If you're a light sleeper or mind noise, I would find a quieter spot. Otherwise, it's great!"
29051,145814611,2017-04-20,111516442,Rachel,Very nice host. Ensure my stay was comfortable. Attentive to my needs
29051,147129948,2017-04-25,122718011,Devin,"I stayed at Edwin' s place and it was perfect for me. The house is in a great location near the tram, restaraunts, etc. Edwin was very nice and helpful. I could walk to anywhere I went from Edwin's in 20 minutes or less. Definitely a great place to stay!"
29051,148985754,2017-05-02,23278549,Gary,Awesome awesome awesome! Centrally located to absolutely everything. Edwin's house was built in the 1600s. The accommodations are authentic Amsterdam and a truly local experience. As an American the purpose of travel for me is to live like a local not to mingle with other Americans. I strive to immerse myself in the culture of the city that I'm visiting. Edwin was able to provide that experience for me. Thank you Edwin for being part of my amazing week in Amsterdam.
29051,149688845,2017-05-05,98946867,Nikolai,Clean and inexpensive room in one of the most lively streets of Amsterdam with a very hospitable and friendly host. 
29051,150150714,2017-05-07,71228421,Rafael,"Edwin is a great host. The place is very clean, the location is more than perfect. Everthing was better than I expected. "

29051,151270655,2017-05-12,27794259,Jackie,"Great space right in the middle of Amsterdam. Walking distance to almost everywhere and lots of transports around. 
Just to notice, the house is in a daily quiet street, but full of bars and restaurants so by night it gets a little noisy. 
Edwin is super nice and helpful. 
Definitely I would return. "
29051,151766905,2017-05-14,104812823,Brittney,Probably one of the best locations you can ask for! Awesome view in rooms! 
29051,154516722,2017-05-25,112221284,Sabrina,"Edwin Guesthouse liegt mitten in Amsterdam in der Nähe des Blumenmarkts und ist sehr gut zu erreichen mit der Tram. In der Umgebung sind Restaurants, Bars und Coffee-Shops. Es kann am Abend/Nacht etwas lauter werden,aber mit Oropax kein Problem. Mein Aufenthalt war super und ich würde immer wieder zu Edwin reisen. Das Zimmer war für 1 Person ausreichend:grosses Bett,Schrank,TV,Handtücher,Duschgel,(Kühlschrank,Wasserkocker,Tee,Kaffee im Treppenhaus),alles was man braucht. Der Check in war unkompliziert ebenso der Check out. Jeder der eine direkte,lebhafte Unterkunft sucht in Amsterdam ist bei Edwin perfekt aufgehoben. "
29051,155017123,2017-05-27,113142050,Martina,The location is very good! But ear plugs may help :)
29051,156827804,2017-06-01,101654871,Jordan,Edwins place was great. Within easy walking distance of everything and a short walk to the tram for the trip to and from the airport 
29051,158090277,2017-06-05,8499146,Chris,"I would like to say I was very lucky to find Edwin's place! What a fantastic location, and place to stay in, it has all the restaurants and bars nearby! And transportation is really easy from there! Although I did a lot of walking! 
Edwin was a fantastic host who always asked if you was okay and took interest in you as a guest... I had no issues with my stay and would stay at Edwin's again. 
The street is very busy but it's also very beautiful, it is the kind of place where you buy a drink sit outside and watch all different kinds of people walk by. 
Ten outta Ten for location! "
29051,158758075,2017-06-08,111676846,Yong,"좋은 위치, 어디든 걸어다니기에 좋습니다."
29051,161116103,2017-06-17,5287810,Marcos,The location was perfect to me. If You like to sleep early maybe the streeth have too much noise but it was not my case!
29051,161991881,2017-06-19,55036814,Rod,"Edwin was very professional and always available. Check in was very smooth and early. Made to feel welcome in Edwin's home. 
Lots of dining and pub options immediately close by. 
Can be a shade noisy at night, but no problem with the windows closed. 
Thank you Edwin!! "
29051,162559613,2017-06-21,110240704,Megan,"Edwin was one of the best hosts I've ever had.  He was so funny and instantly warm and welcoming.  Incredibly helpful, he was available to assist me with ever need.  His cat is adorable and fluffy, and the room was stunning.  In a beautiful and busy alley, it feels like quintessential Amsterdam.  Incredibly close to so many restaurants, museums and historical attractions like Anne Frank's house.  I can't stop talking about how amazing the entire experience was.  "
29051,165494484,2017-07-01,35637052,Bruce,"The room is a charming one, filled with personality - be it the lovely captain's seat and bowed boat windows or the vivid paintings that populate the walls not only in the snug itself but the surround of those very steep stairs.  As suggested this is not a place best suited for a rest cure - the noise at night is unrelenting - but that is all part of the character of the neighbourhood.  For those with a party bent this spot is ripe - and lovely to see so many rainbow flags populating the road.  The location for anyone could not be bettered.  Truly.  The bathroom is clean and well appointed and the musty smell from the shower is only due to the general plumbing and not Edwin's fault at all.  Indeed Edwin as a host could not be bettered.  The kettle in the small hall with complementary tea and coffee was hugely appreciated.  Edwin himself is as handsome as he is conscientious and charming.  To wit: VERY.  On the whole a thumbs up from me.  "
29051,166347554,2017-07-03,43802184,Asha,"This was one of the best Airbnb' I've stayed at! Edwin was great! He was super helpful and had great suggestions on restaurants. As a solo traveler, this location and price were a steal!"
29051,167207874,2017-07-06,59954815,Amy,"Edwin was very easy to communicate with, he responded very quickly to messages. 
His place was nice, it was in a great location that was very central and his instructions for how to find it were  helpful and accurate. As described, it was quite noisy so I would recommend using ear plugs for sleeping. 
It was nice to have a lock on the outside and the inside of the door. 
As a solo female traveller I felt very comfortable staying here and I would recommend it. "
29051,169036250,2017-07-11,38673982,Sarah,"Edwin's place is very central, walkable to anything and everything. Edwin is a kind and generous host and a great communicator. You can't beat the price on this place, either!  "
29051,172438162,2017-07-21,112298679,Sabrina,Foi tudo ótimo. Edwin é muito atencioso e eu aproveitei bastante. Não fiquei muito no quarto pois passei bastante. A vizinhança é bem animada. Gostei e pretendo voltar assim que possível. 
29051,174470535,2017-07-26,102429964,Vinicius,"Muito bem localizado, simples e (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza voltarei quando estiver em Amsterdam!"
29051,175122436,2017-07-28,30974716,Evan,"Edwin has an awesome location not far from many great restaurants, cafes, and bars. The room was great and I would recommend it to anyone."
29051,175890934,2017-07-30,105796822,Bill,Edwin's place is in a great location. I didn't need to use public transport at all during my stay as I could walk everywhere easily. It was easy to find when first arriving and it was very clean. Edwin was a great host and very helpful. 
29051,177611704,2017-08-03,47164223,Mavis,"I had an amazing experience in Amsterdam,thanks for Edwin and he is a very nice person!!! I already fall in love with Amsterdam!"
29051,181089304,2017-08-12,50952781,Harrison,"Although I didn't get to meet Edwin much during my short two night stay at his place, his apartment is the perfect location if you want to be walking distance to anywhere in Central Amsterdam. If you are someone who enjoys nightlife, you are literally a block away from where all the popular bars and clubs are located. Note that if you book this particular room, there WILL be noise ALL night long, so if you are a light sleeper who can't sleep through noisy nights from bar people, then I would not recommend you book this room. Otherwise, if like going out and being central, then Edwin's place is perfect. I hope to return for King's Day!"
29051,182740097,2017-08-15,115925297,Juan León,Edwin fue muy amable. La limpieza del lugar para destacar.
29051,183481461,2017-08-17,137958333,Teaghan,Edwin's place has a beautiful vibe and a generous host. The area is incredible and full of vibes for anyone to enjoy. Wish I stayed longer XOX will be back!
29051,185189614,2017-08-21,19452268,Daniela,"Edwin's place is in the heart of Amsterdam, close to shops, restaurants and nightlife. The room is onto a street with pubs and restaurants. If you are looking for a quiet stay maybe this is not the right place. Edwin is very responsive and kind and always available in case of need. I will recommend the place to my friends!"
29051,186283144,2017-08-24,70289127,Dominik,"Edwins house is located right in Amsterdams city center, with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Because of that it can get a little louder, particularly at night, so I would recommend earplugs, except if you have a high tolerance.
The room is very inviting, with a big, comfy bed, basic interior and a really big window. Outside of the room is a shared bathroom with a toilet, shower and sink, towels get provided.
Together with Edwin there lives a fierce beast in the house called Pookie, the Maine Coon, which can be quite a handful when she's up for a play. She's such a cutie with a lovely character and is always up for some cuddles.
Edwin himself is such a nice and easy-going guy, by that creating a very relaxed atmosphere. It was a pleasure to stay at his guesthouse."
29051,187930416,2017-08-28,36221835,Tywanna,"Edwin's place is amazing! Nice, big bedroom in a house close the everything! When I had trouble understanding the tram(!!), it didn't matter as I was able to walk everywhere! This is an ideal location for anyone interested in being in the center of amsterdam. "
29051,188667118,2017-08-30,122064035,Alejandro,"Edwin was a great host. Located very close to the city center and right by some amazing gay bars, Edwin's room was very comfortable and had everything I needed during my stay for a few nights. He was also very friendly and helpful when I had asked him for tips on where to go and what to do in the city. I definitely recommend Edwin!"
29051,189993576,2017-09-03,44816826,Thibaud,"Thank you for the appartment, it was as described. If I come back to Amsterdam, I will check your ad first, because it is located in the city center, and everything is reachable by walk."
29051,191850095,2017-09-09,6817394,Shaswati,"Pros:
1. Extremely central, beautifully connected by trams to all the tourist locations and even if you want to venture beyond the usual haunts, just walk it. 
2. Very cosy place and the house is spotlessly clean
3. Edwin is a fantastic host -- gives you all the info you need and is great fun to talk to
4. Total value for money

Cons: NONE!"
29051,193034243,2017-09-12,26536033,Lisa,"Edwin ist sehr freundlich, das Zimmer ist sehr gemütlich und praktisch eingerichtet. Lage ist toll, direkt am Blumenmarkt, am Abend ist die Straße unterm Fenster sehr belebt und laut."
29051,194134407,2017-09-16,78136628,Sam,"The location of this flat is incredible! You have tram stations on either side of you should you need them and you hardly do because it is so centrally located you can walk most places. Edwin is a gem, he was the perfect host! As mentioned before it is on a busy nightlife street so it is a bit loud at night, personally I enjoyed listening to the sounds of the city when I wasn't participating. All around fantastic experience!"
29051,195838660,2017-09-21,116155790,Grace,"Great location, central to everything. I walked everywhere. Great little restaurants on the same street. Loved every minute of my Amsterdam stay. Highly recommend Edwin's place."
29051,196518918,2017-09-23,104181587,Wani,"If you want the experience of living in a Dutch house at the heart of the city,  this is the place to be.  It is right behind the Floating Flower Market (Bloemenmarkt) and there is a few watering holes down the street which makes this spot one happening place in the evening for drinks and socialising.  Yet what I love about this stay was the cozy room and the cleanliness.  I especially love the water chamber. It is antique with a touch of modernity and with my room right beside it, it is super convenient.  I was given the front room facing the street on second floor.  It has a good size and comfortable. If you hate the lull of people drinking down below at night, have a noise cancelling headset ready or a simple ear plugs.  For me that was hardly an issue considering the comfort and the location. Edwin is so warm and wonderful, he made me a solo female traveller, welcomed.  It was so nice to see a friendly face in a foreign place that I felt lucky that I booked a stay here even for only two nights. I'd definitely stay here again if I am back in town. Highly recommended!!!"
29051,199188082,2017-10-01,29886661,Jennifer,Perfect for a weekend away... good sized room in clean local house and lively neighbourhood.
29051,202897629,2017-10-13,137213352,Ronn,Typical Dutch house in a walking distance from the central station. In front of a tram stop which is a few stops to the museumplein and the cs. Very clean and comfy bed.
29051,205381057,2017-10-22,22599870,Wenzel,"Freundlichen, hilfsbereiten Gastgeber. Nettes Zimmer. Top Lage: Hot spot Downtown, also bringe am besten Ohrenstöpseln mit..
Der Katze besuchte meinen Zimmer mehrmals . . Und, falls sie wieder raus wollte, machte sie ein dezentes Miaauw. 

Ich gehe mit sicherheit wieder zur Edwins Stelle!!"
29051,206203126,2017-10-24,14106539,Laurent,"Edwin’s place is extremely well located 
Ideal for those who want to be in the heart of this very vibrant city"
29051,206580024,2017-10-26,17063278,Nate,Edwin was a great host.  The place is in a wonderful location right near the floating flower market.  Hopefully I will have a chance to stay here again one day!
29051,207053156,2017-10-28,134219107,Raj,Value for money!! Its near the central station so go ahead and book until it gets all booked !
29051,208207958,2017-10-31,20333899,Katrina,Edwin is such a great host! He was very quick to reply to my queries prior to arrival and he answered all my questions all throughout my stay. He is a lovely host even taking me one night to a tour of the city before I left. The room is tidy and very nicely decorated. Location is very Central with the tram stop about a 1 minute walk from the place. Will book this room again if i’m ever back in Amsterdam. Highly recommend!
29051,208640247,2017-11-02,67750035,Ulysses,"Very good space in the heart of the City Centrum, Edwin is a great host. You might expect some noise at the beginning of the day since it's a busy part of town but when in Amsterdam the last thing you wanna do is sleep!"
29051,209506722,2017-11-05,98009964,Keith,"Edwin was awesome, what a great location! The only reason I knocked a star off was because although the location is wonderful, at night it can be a little loud outside (no fault to Edwin of course, great host!)"
29051,210832801,2017-11-11,32164899,Marius,"Great place in the heart of Amsterdam: bars, restaurants, clubs. Due to the location one has to expect some noise (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Edwin was impeccable. My room and the bathroom were clean. I can recommend the place."
29051,212498295,2017-11-18,124654293,Rossana,"Place is located in the center of the city, very close to everything, and house is located right above a shop and bars, so even if you're not in the mood to walk to can find something to do just by stepping outside the front door."
29051,213272792,2017-11-20,6864128,Georgia And Scott,Great location room with good shared bathroom. Easy to get to and close to everything. The room offered everything I needed. Edwin is a great host and is there to ensure the stay is comfortable. I would also follow up to previous comments about if you don’t like noise then especially on Saturday night then it may not be the place for you. I’m a heavy sleeper so it was fine for me.
29051,213642491,2017-11-22,90527476,Nathan,"Edwin was a great host with good communication and decent instructions on how to arrive.  Unfortunately Edwin did put me in the incorrect room, but offered to change it once he realized.  I declined as I already stayed one night in the incorrect room.  The WiFi in the room I stayed in only worked with the door open so that was also inconvenient.  Bit noisy late at night but that’s expected for the location which was great.  Last thing was that more than two people share the only bathroom which was never an issue for me, but not accurately listed in description."
29051,214658072,2017-11-26,41094079,Coskun,Amazingly central. Friendly people in the local area. Close to great pastry shops and cafes

29051,216264150,2017-12-03,15821611,John,Place was perfect for two nights in Amsterdam! Bed was comfortable and Edwin was a great host.
29051,217056409,2017-12-07,73085135,Eric,Ed does what he can to make sure your stay is chill. He home is right in the center of the a lot of bars and near some cool coffee shops. Ed answered all my many questions and was just a ginuinely nice guy.
29051,218360963,2017-12-12,53767106,Lilian,"Edwin’s place is a very confortable, cozy and warm. It is in a great location, where you can walk pretty much everywhere. If you don’t feel like walking, the tram is a few steps from his house. There are many restaurants, cafés and everything you could need near by. I would highly recomend his place, Edwin is a very friendly and welcoming host! I hope to be back one day!"
29051,219011734,2017-12-16,143588203,Sarah,"Edwin was AMAZING. By far one of the best Airbnb hosts I’ve ever had. I would definitely recommend him and plan on staying with him again whenever I’m back in Amsterdam! He was very friendly and made sure I was enjoying my time there, and checked in with me several times. His place was very cozy and cute. He provided excellent communication and gave wonderful food recommendations as well! 
His place is located on a pretty popular street so in the evenings in can be a little noisy, but coming from a big city I was very used to it. Overall I had an exceptional experience."

The first day, he showed me around town a bit since he was going to a food/art festival. He has some good morning amenities for coffee/tea and even helped me out when I had some laundry to do. "
29051,232986755,2018-02-07,19458547,Alexandra,"Edwin's place is a wonderful space with great value. It is located in the central part of Amsterdam, and it is easy to walk anywhere you'd want to go. In addition to that, Edwin is warm and lovely, and made me feel at home in Amsterdam. He is an absolute delight! Highly recommend. Great for solo travelers."
29051,233923955,2018-02-11,90724297,Matt,"Comfortable bed, good shower.  Great location, walked everywhere I wanted to go.  Perfect place for a solo traveler."

I will be back soon."

29051,239066317,2018-02-28,43116615,Julian,"Loved Edwin's place. Super cozy room with a comfortable bed and view of the street. Great neighborhood - clubs, bars, restaurants, cafes, shopping, floating flower market are all nearby. Easily walked everywhere. 

Edwin was a great communicator and gave excellent suggestions. Cookie the Maine Coon was my favorite part."
29051,239777801,2018-03-03,123950130,David,"Excelente, muy agradable Edwin y mjy abierto a ayudarte tambien. La unica observacion es la calidad del wifi no es muy buena, pero en lo mas importante el alojamiento fue excelente."
29051,241698511,2018-03-10,559974,Antonio,Edwin's place is perfect for anyone looking to stay in the heart of Amsterdam. It is very conveniently located close to everything- including some of the best bars and clubs in town. I would definitely recommend Edwin's place and would stay there again in a heartbeat!
29051,242510222,2018-03-12,50202268,Rhiannon,Overall absolutely loved it! I felt right at home
29051,244151897,2018-03-18,35316733,Love,"Edwin is an attentive host who makes sure the bathroom is clean. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. The view from the room is authentic and truly worth a stay. I would stay here again if I had a chance. The area is actually located near a lot of stuff."
29051,247125160,2018-03-27,87924679,Çağrı,Edwin muhteşem bir adam. Evin fiyatı konumuna göre gayet iyi. Yatak rahattı biraz ses olmasına rağmen kolayca uyudum. Tavsiye ederim.
29051,250178642,2018-04-04,22550054,Dennis,Great location but the street is busy at times and so there was the odd street yelling during the night.
29051,252370171,2018-04-10,68402739,Richard,"Had a nice 5 day stay in this gem in Central AMS.
Edwin is a fantastic host.
Knowledgeable and congenial.
Highly recommended."
29051,254542113,2018-04-17,153403034,Deepesh,"Edwin is a great host, this is a brilliant location to stay while visiting Amsterdam if it is available!!!  location, location, location.
Plus the Host!, room, value.  A+"
29051,255332548,2018-04-20,146453240,Nicholas,"The location is excellent, very central, a good sized room with a very comfortable bed, a little noisy on an evening (as he points out), but it is only people chatting outside the bars, no booming music, so no problem unless you are a light sleeper - it was perfectly fine for me. Nice to be in an old 'Amsterdam style' house rather than a hotel. Would definitely recommend it."
29051,257222092,2018-04-25,9801817,Leilani,"Edwin's place was great! The location is ideal for exploring the city, especially the night life. Personally, I did not find the place to be so loud as other reviewers, but I also live in an urban area. 

Very clean room with a nice view of the street. Incredibly comfortable bed. Great shower.

Edwin is such a kind and charistmatic person! Would definitely recommend his place to others."
29051,258049347,2018-04-28,111467262,Michael,"Great location! Very close to everything and near two trams to get you around. Bed was very comfortable and clean. Only access is to the bedroom and shared bathroom, shared with another AirBnB-er. Kind of awkward but not a big deal. On a street with a lot of noise so bring ear plugs!!! Its very loud. Overall great stay. Edwin even gave me some tips on where to go grab traditional dutch food."
29051,260002269,2018-05-03,15179526,Gabi,Edwin is a great host! The hospitality is 5*plus!!! I can recommend it to everyone in the world! Great to come in contact with such human beings.
29051,261408481,2018-05-06,35101841,Erica,"Stop looking and book. As the review states, there is some nightlife outside however I never had an issue with sleeping. It actually became my background noise and I didn't use my white noise app like I usually do. Amazing location, super amazing host, cool space, everything you need."
29051,262524853,2018-05-09,51762042,Chris,"Edwin's place is at a fantastic location and room was clean and comfortable. There is tram station just 5 min. walk from his place. So it is very easy to access to major tourist attractions in Amsterdam. There are many good restaurants, coffee shops and souvenir shops near by. 
Edwin is excellent host. He communicated very well. 
When I am coming back to Amsterdam I would like to stay here again. Definitely I would recommend this place! "
29051,264554721,2018-05-14,166362822,Eduard,"Amazing Amsterdam and very good location and apartment near of all museum, nice bars and gay and cultural life! I love it!"
29051,265806282,2018-05-18,156529136,Melanie,Wonderful host. Will definitely be booking again.
29051,267151660,2018-05-21,5834167,Luke,"Great location close to bars, perfect for a 2 night stay."

29051,271682082,2018-06-02,65925524,Alejandra,"Don’t think twice and book. This is my second time at Edwin’s and his place is just as I remembered, amazing. The location is great you can walk everywhere or choose to take the tram, there are two stops really close by. My room was perfectly clean and the bathroom is always clean as well.  Best location to stay in Amsterdam. It can be loud at night, I personally love it but if you are a light sleeper take earplugs. There are literally tons of restaurants and bars down below you can get food or a drink at almost any time! I will book it again when I return to Amsterdam. Best choice!"
29051,273494437,2018-06-06,42641472,Josh,"Edwin's house is in a perfect location, an easy walk to just about anywhere you want and trams are close as well. It's a party street, but if you don't mind a little noise at night, I would highly recommend."
29051,275555038,2018-06-11,66184475,Elizabeth,"Incredible Airbnb! The place is in a perfect location, everything was within a 20-30 minute walk. It was also very close to the tram. There are a lot of bars, restaurants and a few “Coffeeshops”  in the neighborhood so you can expect a lot of noise, but I had earplugs so the noise didn’t really bother me. The location and the comfortable atmosphere of the room was worth the noise. Edwin is a very friendly host."
29051,278547393,2018-06-18,45173445,Dennis,Excellent location. Best for those who enjoy nightlife 
29051,281556980,2018-06-25,22686408,David & Yonit,"Edwin is a pleasant easy going guy, his place is spacious with large windows and a view bang in the centre where all the bars and restaurants in the central canal district. Plenty if hot water  comfortable bed large room shared bathroom which was ok.
Nothing was missing
You need to climb a few stairs but thats no problem. Cat is friendly too. Recommended if sharing a bathroom is ok and you have no problem with stairs I would happily come back and I would like to."
29051,282784109,2018-06-28,51973800,Joel,"Edwin’s place was very convenient and tidy! Do note that this room was up a narrow stairway which Edwin very kindly helped me with my suitcase. Overall, I had a pleasant stay and would happily stay here again. :)"
29051,283598259,2018-06-30,30757514,Dwyer,Nice clean bright single room. Comfy bed and plenty of fresh air. easy to keep cool.  Very central location with everything on your doorstep. Edwin is friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend to stay here. Other people have mentioned that it is busy in the street at night. If you are a light sleeper then ear plugs would be a good idea to bring. Not crazy noise but its nice to keep the windows open wide for air.  Bathroom was good as well.
29051,284870577,2018-07-02,89130780,Ale,Muy recomendable
29051,285677813,2018-07-04,21193030,Mauricio,"Everything went well, Edwin was a good host and his apartment had all I needed. The location was nice, my only point is about the noice of the street at night, but I guess it is similar around Amsterdam. The stairs are small and dangerous, especially trying to climb the baggage, but I also think it is something very particular in this city."
29051,287638215,2018-07-08,127820678,Vivien,Au top chandre et salle de bain propre le lit et confortable edwin et super accueillant y'a rien à dire
29051,289339550,2018-07-12,27615684,Abigail,"Excellent stay, prime location. AMS has excellent public transportation but I hardly bothered, since everything I wanted to see was within walking distance. Edwin is great host. Bed very comfortable and the street noise didn't bother me a bit! I'll certainly plan to stay here again my next time in AMS."
29051,289930044,2018-07-13,130986419,Dustin,The best! Perfect location and perfect place to stay. I will be back!
29051,292133333,2018-07-17,49901455,Xiaojie,"I was arrived quite late, Edwin was helped with my Luggage which is not easy to get in there. The room is clean, sharing bathroom is not a problem for me. Edwin clean and dry it all the time.  But if you have a light sleep will be not easy for you, they can music whole night downstairs during the weekend. For me probably because I have a jet lag so I got really sleepy. But I can hear someone still in high at 5am. "
29051,294003577,2018-07-21,178350418,Tony,Edwin is a great host and the room is comfortable. 
29051,295856149,2018-07-24,126110941,Cory,"One of my favorite Airbnb I have stayed at. It is very central to the city with multiple metro lines within walking distance. There are lots of good bars, food places, and things to see just 100’s of feet away. Do not hesitate to book. On the weekends the bar down the street can be a little loud but windows shut it’s not bad at all, the stairs are steep like most old houses in the city so be prepared. The entire place was very clean and welcoming. The location was very secure and felt very safe. "
29051,296981437,2018-07-27,148089322,Eleanor,Edwin’s Guesthouse will not disappoint if you are a solo traveler! It was a home away from home and the host is the NICEST!
29051,300541378,2018-08-02,20824129,Nico,"Edwin's place is in a nice central location in Amsterdam, very close to lots of interesting spots and is very accessible but thankfully the area doesn't get too out of hand at night time. I would recommend staying with Edwin, and will probably try to stay there for my next trip to Amsterdam."
29051,302063528,2018-08-05,127388553,Sofia,"If you are going to Amsterdam to explore the city this is the best place to stay. Very central, all the attractions just in a walking distance and you are in the very heart of nightlife. It is extremely clean everywhere. The room is cosy and functional. The bed is very comfortable. It was hard to leave it, but Amsterdam was calling right from the window. Poocky is a hairy and lovely bonus!"
29051,303751615,2018-08-08,169203620,Jessica,"Great location, very clean and functional space for a single traveler. Highly recommend. "
29051,305534223,2018-08-11,162008186,Morgan,Perfect location! Access to everything via foot but tram available. Clean. Plenty of privacy. Would stay here again. 
29051,306928509,2018-08-13,18615339,Rainey,Excellent!!
29051,312212437,2018-08-23,138343239,Li,"Edwin is a FANTASTIC host. He is friendly and nice and he is always there for you. The apartment was GREAT in every aspect and Edwin, who is thoughtful and unbelievably friendly, provided everything I needed. I’m so grateful for everything and I hope I’ll have a chance to stay here again. "
29051,314156122,2018-08-26,33860099,Syn,Quick response when I requested to stay at Edwin’s place for a couple nights. Host even messaged me the day before to give me helpful directions on how to get to the location using public transportation from the airport. Lots of places to go that are walking distance. 
29051,318699082,2018-09-04,162274559,Jaqueline Aparecida,"Eu amei. Viajei sozinha e super recomendo. Edwin é simpático e muito educado. O quarto estava bem limpo e arrumado... Fica próximo a diversos pontos turisticos e da pra fazer tudo a pé mesmo... eu voltaria com certeza. Obrigada, Edwin"
29051,319333961,2018-09-06,86118245,Ronald,"Edwin’s place is a must stay. The home was better than I could have ever expected it to be. The location is great and right in Amsterdam; Great for getting around through the day easily. Edwin takes time to ensure the room is clean and also has wonderful communication. Additionally, I loved the feel of the pillows on the bed.

The only downside is the noise outside of the room. But you’re in the middle of a busy city and if you read the reviews ahead of time then you know what to expect prior to staying. Just bring some earplugs and you’ll be just fine. I had no problems getting to sleep.

I would stay with again and recommend to anyone looking for a great find in the area."
29051,320603273,2018-09-09,175043770,Gillian,"Perfect central  location with all tourist sites, transport and eating places within easy walking distance.  Edwin’s local knowledge is great. The accommodation is historical and quaint. I wish I could have stayed longer. You must be able to climb stairs"
29051,322541817,2018-09-13,9084254,Emily,"Booked this apartment for the location which was extremely central! Great spot, plenty around!"
29051,324946524,2018-09-18,141020654,Cameron,"The location was perfect. Edwin's place is not far down the road from Leidsesplein, a common stop for the trams in the city, so getting back was always very easy. I made all my plans so that I could end up back near my room to take a midday break and I don't know that this would be as easily accomplished in most homes."
29051,326992258,2018-09-23,767530,Tobias,"Der Aufenthalt in Amsterdam hat voll und ganz meinen Wünschen entsprochen. Lage zentral und lebendig. Der Raum ist sehr charmant und hat ein schönes Licht. Nachteil: es ist nachts wirklich laut (wie schon beschrieben) und etwas kalt, da alte Fenster. Ich kann jedoch den Aufenthalt dort empfehlen."
29051,328806877,2018-09-27,25895030,Alissa,Great place! Right near so many things. It is loud at night but that was to be expected based on other reviews. I’d stay again! Great location for the value.
29051,330896062,2018-10-01,31168283,Kay,"Edwin's Guesthouse is in a great location in a lively neighborhood. He is accommodating and very friendly. The room was clean and bright,.and I loved staying in a place built nearly 400 years ago!"

29051,339084217,2018-10-21,27428961,Juan,Best place to stay in Amsterdam. Great location and Edwin a great host. He was very kind and helpful.

29051,346097813,2018-11-07,34778182,Claire,"Edwin’s accommodations are comfortable and central, perfect for first time visitors to the city. Edwin was very friendly and helpful during my stay. It’s a noisy location on the weekends, but I slept great with earplugs. Thanks for everything, Edwin!"
29051,347289545,2018-11-11,16402351,Chase,Edwin does an excellent job communicating with you and gives great local tips. Fantastic host!
29051,349073277,2018-11-16,3818972,Ian,"The location was great. It was a bit noisy at times on the street below but not too bad, and I was made aware of it beforehand. Great place!"
29051,351521452,2018-11-23,122418360,Lucy,"Perfect place to stay. Edwin was a great host. The room was brilliant. Clean, cosy and warm. The building was beautiful and the decor was lovely. All the necessary facilities were available and the location is ideal for exploring the city centre. Edwin was really helpful with local tips. The only slight issue was the noise at night (some bars and clubs on the road) but was fine after I got to sleep. Would definitely recommend staying here."
29051,352991925,2018-11-26,144505391,Cody,Amazing! So thankful for Edwin and his awesome home!
29051,353711214,2018-11-29,782197,Ketan,"Edwin's single room is perfect for one and the bed is surprisingly comfortable. The bathroom is shared and kept clean. The place itself is centrally located. Overall, an easy and convenient stay. Thank you again Edwin!"
29051,355257379,2018-12-03,197032951,David,Great host and perfect location - close to everything you need but not too busy or touristy. Would definitely stay here again if I come back to Amsterdam
29051,355704327,2018-12-05,117261720,Jonas,"Edwin is a really cool host with a really well located apartment, a lot of nice paintings on the wall."
29051,356419393,2018-12-08,148395530,Amir Ahmad,"As other reviewers have already pointed out, Edwin is a great host, the location is great although a bit noisy at night, and the room was clean. The wifi was a bit slow though."
29051,360082476,2018-12-19,1745958,Warren,"Edwin is a fantastic host and has created an equally fantastic location. Just off the famous tulip market and butted against a lively street full of clubs, it's the perfect place to get an immediate dose of what Amsterdam has to offer. HIGHLY recommended."
29051,360970536,2018-12-22,31086237,Sreerupa,"The guesthouse is at a very convenient location - very close to the Centraal station. The room and the bathroom were clean and Edwin provided most of the amenities you would need. However, even though the location is convenient, the house is on a very crowded street, so expect noise all through the day and night."
29051,362429915,2018-12-26,132228712,Miguel,"Ok, I usually do not write long reviews, but bear with me. I stayed at Edwin’s home for 4 nights and the price was great comparing to the other options available. The room and bed are spacious enough for 1 or 2 people (bed was comfortable). However, the bathroom is small, but manageable (doesn’t dry well). Warning, steep spiral steps (like all other places in Amsterdam); so if you have a suitcase you would need to carry it well above your hip to go up. Also, no “visitors” after 10pm.

In the listing, Edwin does not mention that he has a cat, Mooki. She’s sweet and decided to spend a night with me lol (tbh I was skeptic at first, but let her stay). One of the other guests is allergic, so it’s worth mentioning.

Now onto my review, the most aggravating aspect of my stay is that the keys, locks and doors DON’T work properly. I can’t tell you how bad it was trying to get in the front door for 20 minutes out in the cold late night (morning?), and THEN another 15 to get into the room (which I did not bother to lock after the first night). Repeatedly. 

In the second night I had the same hardship to enter, to which I texted him through AirBnB. Did not get a response, but eventually I somehow managed to enter AND notified him. Fast forward some hours (I’m already asleep) and all of a sudden he is violently beating on the door to my room trying to open it (I had the hook-lock on). I can’t tell you how uncomfortable it was to be woken up this way. After I opened the door, he realized what happened and apologized. Dude, I texted you for a reason. Another night I had the same lock and key trouble, but didn’t get a response until 5:48 am.

The location of the house is in the heart of the city and the street has several restaurants. I’m a heavy sleeper naturally, but it was difficult to sleep because of the noise. I’m surprised the Dutch/tourists were screaming and being so loud in a street that has no bars or reason to behave that way.

Overall, I would rate Edwin’s AirBnB  3.5/5.
-1 for communication 
-1 for the damn keys and locks
-.5 for the noise (which Edwin has no control over)

Pros:
-close to the Metro and all the action
-cheap when compared to other listings at the time of booking"
29051,363194350,2018-12-28,77179435,Gerardo,Close to center.  A bit noisy at night.
29051,365237574,2019-01-01,17425490,Lucy,"Edwin's place was perfect for my visit. When you enter the house, there is winding staircase, Edwin's cousin was staying in the downstairs flat, you keep climbing and on the second floor is this room, the bathroom, and the double room. Up one more flight is the attic room. The layout is very convenient and private.

 The room is more spacious than pictured and there is a closet for your clothes. On the second floor, there  is a small communal fridge and tea kettle. The bathroom is communal but is cleaned everyday. Edwin is very responsive and the location is perfect. The bed and pillows are very comfy! Like with many older buildings, the keys can be finicky so you must be gentle when inserting the key and unlocking the door."
29051,367244092,2019-01-04,76844352,Hari,"I was delighted with the hospitality, it was nice staying  at this place with great sorroundings and where you could find the most of amsterdam near everywhere :)"
29051,369355855,2019-01-10,176872030,Melissa,"This is a good option for travelers on a budget. The room has ample space for your belongings and it’s very conveniently located in central Amsterdam. The host rents out a double room and a single attic room in the same unit, so you share the  bathroom with up to three other guests. As others have noted, there is a lot of noise from the street, but I played white noise on my computer and slept fine. The locks are old and can be tricky to use. I couldn’t get the hang of the lock to my room so I left my room unlocked during the day. I had some trouble unlocking the door to the building, as well. In the future I think the host should provide instructions on how to properly lock and unlock the building door. Merely closing it isn’t enough - you have to really force or slam the door shut to lock it. I think other guests didn’t get this memo because the door was sometimes left unlocked during my stay."
29051,400835813,2019-01-13,222936671,Joseph,"This is in a great location! There are a number of bars on the street, as well as some pretty nice restaurants. That being said, the noise from people walking around and leaving bars is pretty loud until around 4am. I didn't mind it because I was out late and just passed out as soon as I got back. Another thing to note is that the stairs in Edwin's house are very narrow so it can be hard to bring a full-sized suitcase up the stairs. If you travel light, you shouldn't have any problems though. I'd definitely stay there again! :)"
29051,403111457,2019-01-20,220260642,Maciej,Edvin's guesthouse it's a great place in the heart of Amsterdam. Very polite Host and perfect quality of hospitality service. Hope to come back soon!

29051,405409721,2019-01-27,147517666,Kyle,"Edwin's home is the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. Situated a short 10-15 minute walk from Centraal Station, it is super easy to find and right in the heart of a busy little street full of bars, cafes and restaurants, so you'll never need to go far to find great food and great nightlife. However, as you explore further afield you will find that you are never very far from the highlights of Central Amsterdam and all it has to offer. Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein, the city's prime nightlife spots, are a short distance away, as is Vondelpark if you are looking for somewhere to chill out in the day. The Red Light District and most of the city's museums are also situated within a 10-15 minute walk in any direction. You really will struggle to find the need to use public transport as everything you need is within easy walking distance. 

The home itself is very charming and Edwin is a wonderful host. Upon entering you will climb a spiral staircase to the first floor where you will find Edwin's living quarters. A further floor up and you will find two private rooms and a bathroom all connected by a communal landing where you can find a small shared fridge and tea making area. The room in which I stayed was plenty spacious, featured some lovely artwork (a theme running throughout the house) and was super comfortable. and I mean super comfortable. The bed was soft yet firm, and the huge pillows a delightful place to rest your head. It is a little noisy, as others have noted, but it's merely a little background noise. 

I certainly would not hesitate to stay at Edwin's place again when I next visit Amsterdam and I would strongly recommend it to all fellow tourists and travellers as it is superb value for money. I am sure you will not be disappointed."
29051,407946948,2019-02-03,118570202,Vishal,great time! Edwin is awesome host and super helpful. recommend!
29051,409298815,2019-02-07,52046283,David,Great location and nice accommodations. It is in city around plenty of bars so expect plenty of noise at night. I slept fine none the less.
29051,413239093,2019-02-17,93998637,Kiet,"Edwin’s home is in the heart of Amsterdam.  If you looking actions all around, this property give great values.  Of course, there will be a few amenities one needs to sacrifice. 

I had great stay at Edwin’s guesthouse. Everything was walking distance and I decided to rented a bike to explore other part of this city.  Edwin was friendly and approachable.  

This place will not an idea place for light sleeper. I was okay with noises out on the street. Sleep aid,
music, and ear plugs does help.  Fyi. 

Hope to visit Amsterdam again for King’s day, and I would be welcome back. Thank you Edwin for your hospitality.  "
29051,418927635,2019-03-03,23196262,Hana,위치가 중심부에 있어서 관광지 이동에 좋습니다. 반면에 주말 밤에는 근처 취객들로 시끄러워서 잠들기 힘들 수 있어요.  고양이는 너무 예쁘고 귀엽고 Edwin은 응답이 매우 빨랐습니다. 침대시트가 좀 오래된 느낌이라 찝찝했지만 가격대비 나쁘지 않은 방이에요.
29051,424832233,2019-03-17,248141702,Firat,Warm hospitality and a really comfortable room!
29051,426193187,2019-03-20,191778274,Kaya,"Edwin is an marvelous host and has a great sense of humor! I highly recommend this place for any traveler trying to be in the middle of the city! The location is perfect, and great food surrounds you. Everything is in walking distance, so I wouldn’t even bother with the metro! About a 15-20 minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal station, but streets are small, so not a great walk if you have tons of luggage. Thanks again, Edwin!"
29051,426855452,2019-03-22,36766515,Laila,"I live in Amsterdam myself, but needed a few nights in a hotel. I found Edwins place, and thought it was VERY cheap for the location. 
I read that Edwin was a happy, friendly guy, and still I was surprised by how friendly he is! 
And the location is really amazing. When you are a tourist visiting Amsterdam, this is a really great spot! His house is in a street between Reguliersdwarsstraat (""Amsterdams most famous gay street"" and the famous flower marked. Area is full of restaurants and bars, a guaranteed fun time awaiting right at your doorstep. Close to Leidseplein, Rembrandsplein, Dam Square. All the shopping you can wish for, short way home with your bags.  You will be living smack in the middle of all the good stuff. :-) 
It goes without saying that when you stay in such a lively spot you need a pair of earplugs for when you want to go to sleep. 
Comfy bed, shared bathroom, great way to see how the Amsterdammers live, while climbing up the steep stairs. Do like the locals.  
I would recommend Edwins place to anybody!"
29051,428946965,2019-03-26,12555030,Jason,"Edwin's place is in prime location. There are restaurants, bars, and shopping all within seconds of his place. Communication was really great, too. The previous guest had checked out early, so Edwin let me in about three hours prior to my scheduled time. TIP: Make sure you bring ear plugs; Edwin's space is two floors above a street with many popular clubs and restaurants. It is loud until 3am. I slept just fine with ear plugs, though. I would definitely stay here again."
29051,429850065,2019-03-29,124248088,Oliver,"Thoughtful host, gives quick and useful responses to questions and makes sure you feel welcome."

29051,432965019,2019-04-05,172763111,Charles,Great price in a great location.  No issues what so ever.  I noticed someone reported an issue with their keys. The keys work fine for me. Would stay again!
29051,433843774,2019-04-07,3699714,Jörg,Everything was perfect. The Communication was super. The Location is close to everything. Restaurants and Bars are very close. In the middle of street life- which i love. Would recommend the place and i‘ll try to come back.
29051,435393122,2019-04-10,235997971,German,"Everything was good including the location, but a bit noicy at night because of the bars and restaurants in the street downstairs"
29051,438698463,2019-04-17,113844869,Jovan,"Edwin is a MARVELOUS HOST. He was very helpful in any way. The place is clean, cozy and in the hart of the town. I would definitely recommend it and visit it again."
29051,441693578,2019-04-22,65755098,Benjamin,"Edwin’s place is absolutely perfect. Situated in a great area, making it easy to walk anywhere in the city or hop on the trams located just 1 minute from the Airbnb. Everything was very clean, my room was nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable. 

Edwin is a perfect host. So kind and helpful. Really a nice guy- although he is upstaged by Pookie (his cat), who is the true star of the listing. 

Thanks so much for everything!"
29051,442679172,2019-04-24,237489982,Eric,I really enjoyed my stay at Edwin’s place. It’s pretty much a perfect location for all things central Amsterdam. The street he is on is a great side street with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops that also connects to major  streets for tram/ trolly It was a perfect choice for my exploration of this amazing area. Having such a sweet location allows you to pop back over to your room with ease.  Thanks Edwin!
29051,444628874,2019-04-28,10526483,Fabien,"Edwin is very nice and the Flat is very close of the centre, i recommand"
29051,446283095,2019-05-01,235675145,Frauke,"Die Lage ist super , sehr zentral in der schönen Altstadt. Nur einen Katzensprung vom Blumenmarkt entfernt. Einen tollen Kater, ohne jede Scheu, gibt es auch."
29051,451260330,2019-05-11,82671406,Diane,"Fantastic area, can’t be beat. Walked everywhere, no cabs or buses needed. Edwin keeps your room so clean & if lucky, you get a visit from Pookie the cat. Great breakfast/lunch right below, everything you need on same street! Relaxing lounge & coffee shop next door. Enjoyed my daily journeys. Right in middle of all attractions. Best Host & stay.
Will be back, thanks Edwin"
29051,452881695,2019-05-14,174413972,David,Great place to stay for the price! A bit noisy at night but it’s like that everywhere near the city centre.
29051,454467936,2019-05-18,240119115,Felipe,I met Edwin and I instantly felt his good vibes. He was like a friend from long time ago. He took me to places gave me tips and was very respectful of my space.
29051,455871959,2019-05-20,6391389,Neli,Great central location and a very warm host!
29051,457015047,2019-05-23,194406459,Rodrigo,Loved the location! Great central location to all main attractions and train stop is a minute away. Edwin was very attentive during my stay would definitely stay there again.
29051,458611694,2019-05-26,178107265,Beatrice,"Mein Zimmer war klein, aber ausreichend. Alles war sauber und liebevoll eingerichtet. Das Haus liegt mitten in der Stadt, somit ist man schnell überall. Ich habe mir ein Fahrrad gemietet, da waren die Wege kurz. Für Lärmempfindliche ist die Unterkunft allerdings nicht zu empfehlen. Das Nachtleben tobt direkt vor der Tür, das ist relativ laut. Wen das nicht stört oder wer gute Ohrenstöpsel hat, dem seien Edwins Zimmer wärmstens empfohlen. Er ist sehr nett, und wenn man Glück hat bekommt man auch mal Besuch des Hauskaters, die Fremden gegenüber sehr entspannt ist. "
29051,461850915,2019-06-01,209080985,Héloïse,"Super chambre, tres confortable et très propre. Un petit peu bruyant mais très bien placé ! Super ! Je recommande."
29051,463819942,2019-06-04,24431072,Emily,"Super good location in the centre city! I visited every sites on foot and enjoy the beautiful views and canal on my way! Edwin is very nice person and very helpful! This room definitely worthy of money, I was lucky to find it! The only thing needs to notice is do bring your earplugs as the street is very excited during the night. :)"
29051,465804307,2019-06-08,201362711,Irina,"Отличное расположение, все достопримечательности в пешей доступности, рядом метро и трамвайная остановка, магазин.
Эдвин очень приветлив и ненавязчив. Познакомилась с кошкой :)
Рядом много кафе и баров по улице - ночью до 2-3 часов шумно, утром шумно из-за уборочных машин.  
Комната на 3м этаже, лестница крутая.
В общем коридоре есть маленький холодильник, чай, кофе.
Иногда не возможно было подключиться к wifi, но для меня это не было проблемой.
Были небольшие проблемы с ключом от входной двери дома, но открыть дверь занимало не более 3 минут."
29051,468305391,2019-06-12,12138254,Monika,Edwin’s place is lovely. It’s a great little Dutch room with a good view. The location is very central. Although the street can get a little noisy on the weekend.
29051,469754309,2019-06-15,45653593,재준,"He is a kind and caring host. He didn't interfere to my private time except to let me know and take care of what I needed. The house is on the good location and a busy street. It's a little noisy in the evening, but not loud to beat the fatigue of the trip. You will be satisfied if you aren't person who expect a few times bigger than that you paid. So if I come to Amsterdam again, I want to stay in this house again."
29051,471750845,2019-06-18,35995758,Matt,"Casa de Edwin did not disappoint! So close, no need to trams. Lovely little room in a lively area. ‘Pookie’ the cat is an added bonus!

Highly recommend if you’re staying in Amsterdam."
29051,474480404,2019-06-23,118853856,Jesse,"I cannot stress how fantastic a location this is. This is perfectly situated to go anywhere from. I was hesitant to rent a single room in someone’s home at first, but the room is very very private, clean, and stylish. Edwin was fantastic at communicating and check-in/out was easy. Highest recommendations."
29051,475963471,2019-06-25,32140672,Betsy,"Perfect location, comfortable bed, and Edwin was a really fantastic and responsive host! I highly recommend this space for an Amsterdam visit!"

29051,485567439,2019-07-11,13479658,Peter,Edwin's place is right in the centre of things which makes it convenient for people who have only a few days in Amsterdam. Edwin was a good host.
29051,488582179,2019-07-15,38283020,Jared,"Perfect location when traveling to Amsterdam. Very easy to get to from the airport. The place is close to all the major attractions, cafes, food, and bars. Edwin was very helpful and there was more room then i expected. Definitely would stay here again."

You will be staying in authentic Amsterdam house and you will have the friendliest host.  Room is much bigger than pictured.  Edwin cleans everyday before you wake up and the bed is comfortable."
29051,508607094,2019-08-13,6516346,Lea,La habitación es como de ve en las fotos; limpia y con suficiente espacio para dos personas. La ubicación de la casa es inmejorable. Edwin es amable y atento; además responde rápido. El único inconveniente es que la calle es muy ruidosa e incluso con la ventana cerrada se oye el ruido de los bares y restaurantes de abajo hasta pasada la medianoche. Por lo demás; precio-calidad es buena y es un lugar recomendable
29051,510011692,2019-08-15,38579149,Gabriela,"My stay in Amsterdam at Edwin’s place was fantastic!!! Great location, clean and cozy! And Edwin is an awesome host, very responsive and helpful!! Definitely I would like to repeat!! :)"

I felt at home the moment I checked in and  I liked that the host was contactable so I could meet him. That made my stay more enjoyable being able to chat with a local. Loved my stay at Edwins. ❤️"

29051,532706369,2019-09-20,55898799,Ema,Ubicación inmejorable en pleno centro de Ámsterdam! Al lado del mercado de las flores y podes llegar caminando a todos los puntos turísticos incluso desde la estación Amsterdam central. Me sentí muy cómodo y la habitación es súper cómoda y más grande que en las imágenes. El trato fue muy bueno. Cómo aspecto negativo es que en las noches se escucha mucho ruido ya que se encuentra en una zona de bares y es complicado dormir.
29051,535304978,2019-09-24,42081263,Amanda,"It was an overall awesome trip, staying in a comfortable room in the middle of the city.

29051,547928899,2019-10-16,20495672,Linnea,"Edwin is quick to respond and gives helpful recommendations. The room is cute and clean. The bed was comfortable. The location is close to anything you'd want to see, with tram lines close by. I read the other reviews and brought ear plugs. You will need them. It does quiet down after midnight but in the early hours it wasn't unusual for a few people to walk down the street yelling or arguing or singing with no regard for anyone in the neighborhood. If you know what your in for, the price and location can't be beat."

If you sometimes go in circle visiting various places and need to drop some items off so you don't carry a lot with you, Edwin's place has convenient location and is accessible from multiple sides. Thanks a lot again Edwin. :)"
29051,555834966,2019-10-28,132020774,Graziano,"Edwin is a perfect host. He keeps the old house clean and efficient and very well aired. His cat is very well educated, clean, shy and respectful, so you won't have any problem. I got the chance to see the beautiful cat only one time in five days. The house is perfectly located but overlooking the most crowded street of Amsterdam at night, the parties are like taking place in your room like it or not and the weekend seems to be starting on Tuesdays in Ams!"

31080,422962,2011-08-06,551927,Jevgenij,"Apartments are absolutely gorgeous. Quiet and relaxing environment,. 1 double and two singles bedrooms, also large living room combined with kitchen. Kitchen is fully equipped, it also has washing machine, drier and dishwasher. It is just 15-20 minutes away from Central Station using tram. All we needed was by hand. 
To rent that apartments was a brilliant idea. Highly recommend for everybody."
31080,497118,2011-09-03,424524,Julian,"A great apartment in a great location.
My family of 2 adults and 2 kids fit just fine in this welcoming apartment.
3 bedrooms was a treat and just what we needed to end our European jaunt.

WiFi, washing machine and real kitchen where all a top notch and helped make us feel like we where in our home and not a short stay apartment.

There was a fantastic welcome info pack too. That had all the relevant info at a finger tips reach.

Thank you

Highly Recommended"

Vorbehaltlose Empfehlung :-)."
31080,2062891,2012-08-22,2453851,Marta,"Beautiful and cozy apartment! It's comparable in size with two floors house. Quiet narrow streets and friendly neighbors are ideal conditions to relax after exploring the city. There are a couple of shops with affordable prices nearby, and of course a channel with a bridge. It takes around 20 minutes to get to the City center on tram; Vondelpark, Van Gogh museum, Paradiso ~10 minutes. 

Nienke is very caring and attentive hostess. She has been always in touch with us, to make us feel like at home. Her daughter Wendeline despite the office hours helped us with the late check-out (Thank you Nienke and Wendeline!)

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who want to spend unforgettable holidays in Amsterdam."
31080,4606745,2013-05-14,2435305,Marc,"I booked for my brother and his friends, because the hotel declined so short before arrival.

I was very happy for the fast reaction and communication with Nienke!

My brother and his friends enjoyed very the flat! It's near from everything in Amsterdam! The home is perfect for the stay with friends, comfortable and has everything you need to cook and live like at home :)

Special the outdoor part of the apartement, was great for chilling!

Thank you so much for hosting!
That's why I love Airbnb!

31080,11336319,2014-03-30,11896685,Izabela,Excellent place to stay. Very clean and big! The top level is adorable and the terrace is great for relaxing. We had everything what we need! Also very close to shops and some restaurants. Easy access to the center of Amsterdam or to the central station (only one tram). The host was always in touch and helpful. easy to contact! Recommend this place to any one who needs a peaceful place but still very close to the center of Amsterdam! Thank you! 
31080,12116881,2014-04-23,12393079,David,"Nienke was a great host , explained everything about the house before and on arrival .The area is really quiet and is a good place to stay the number 2 tram around the corner is ideal for heading into the city , a taxi will cost around 20 euro.

We were greeted by a beer also which was good.

Thanks Nienke !"
31080,13181642,2014-05-21,13601803,Kari S,"We were super happy with this apartment, it's bigger than it looks in the pictures, and the balcony is very nice. All three bedrooms were of a good size as well. 
The host was easy to contact, getting the keys and information on arrival worked well. The apartment is not too far from Vondelpark, which was great. It was on a nice and quiet street. We loved it!"
31080,13880539,2014-06-07,14484919,Janet,"The beautiful apartment with three bedrooms was perfect for our week stay in Amsterdam. It was a beautiful apartment, easy to get to transportation and local shops. Nienke met us and had some good reference material for visitors. It was a great visit. "

il correspond bien aux photos
le logement et le quartier étaient très plaisants
le logement est a un quart d heure du centre par le bus n2

nous avons passe un très bon sejour"
31080,19023098,2014-09-05,2242272,Goni,"Our stay in Amsterdam was lovely, much of it thanks to Nienke's home and her welcoming hospitality. The apartment was so nice, well equipped and cozy, that it was more tempting to stay there than go out to the rain…The street is very quiet and you feel like you are in a truly non-touristic Amsterdam. It is nice to walk from there to the center, the park, the museums or De Pijp, but it's a bit far and you can always take a tram that stops close-by.
We recommend this place whole-heartedly.    
"
31080,20281534,2014-09-27,4639750,Christopher,"Die sehr schöne Wohnung sah aus wie beschrieben. Nienke war eine sehr gute Gastgeberin. Auch eine kurzfristig angekündigte Änderung der Anreisezeit war kein Problem für sie.
Die Wohnung liegt in einer ruhigen und sauberen Gegend. Die nächste Straßenbahnhaltestelle ist nur ein paar Minuten zu Fuß entfernt.
Zusammengefasst: alles bestens."

She was very friendly and made us feel very welcome.
The flat is lovely, spacious and clean. The upstairs room is very light and comfortable with a lovely outside space. We spent a long time there! The kitchen has everything you need. I particularly loved the expresso machine.
Thea area is good with some lovely restaurants nearby and 2 min walk from the tram. Line two goes to all major attractions in the city which is very handy.
I strongly recommend Nikki's place."
31080,32693708,2015-05-20,30764935,Kaan,She is very pretty host and her house was really comfortable. We had really good time in her house and it is easy to go city center from there. Thanks for everything...
31080,37060854,2015-07-04,32076163,N,"We had a wonderful stay at Nienke's apartment.  She greeted us, helped us with our bags, and gave us a great orientation, including tips on bike rides.  The apartment is lovely, well-stocked and had everything that we needed, including good maps.  It is in a good location, in a quiet neighborhood with convenient food shops and cafes and pretty close to the southern end of the Vondelpark, which we traversed to get into the heart of the city.  Nienke also went out of her way to arrange a cab for us when we left.  I highly recommend her place!"
31080,67932971,2016-04-01,10233811,Elizabeth,Nienke's lovely sun-fille aeirie was a perfect place to come back to every evening. We felt very at home. The neighborhood gives a taste of non-tourist Amsterdam with great provisions and transportation. Don't miss a walk or bike ride through the Vondelpark on your way into the museums one day!
31080,71739125,2016-04-28,1516685,Cherry,wonderful apartment! tidy and comfortable! it just feel like  home! good location and very convenient! highly recommend!

The apartment itself is great, spacious and well equipped as well as being closely linked to transport routes both to get there from the airport and to get into the city centre. All 3 bedrooms were extremely comfy and overall you could not fault the apartment. Overall we couldn't recommend staying here highly enough and will definitely look at staying here again should we come back to Amsterdam!"
31080,149042590,2017-05-02,43755771,Oana,The place is ideal for friends with no kids and the area is very quiet and bohemian. Very easy to reach the city center.
31080,156596958,2017-05-31,18368048,Vincent,"Nienke's apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable. It was nicely decorated and very well-equipped. We stayed for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 
There are various transportation options available close by. Tram line no. 2 with a stop near the apartment was very convenient. It would bring you to most of the touristic sites like the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Dam Square and the Central Station. 
Nienke welcomed us in person. She was very friendly. Communication with her was easy. Her apartment was perfect for families visiting Amsterdam. "
31080,174614322,2017-07-26,81798447,Lorenza,Io e la mia famiglia siamo stati ospiti di Nienke a luglio 2017. La sua casa è accogliente e luminosa. Si trova in un quartiere residenziale vicino a negozi e supermercati e alla fermata del tram che in 15 minuti porta in centro città. Nienke è un ottima padrona di casa pronta a consigliare e aiutare in caso di bisogno. Se pensate di andare ad Amsterdam questa è una sistemazione ideale.
31080,179419893,2017-08-07,15715414,Claire,a beautiful apartment in a convenient part of the suburbs . very friendly and helpful host.
31080,191671477,2017-09-08,141562273,Clare,"The apartment was in the suburbs, so about 25 minutes tram ride to central station, but near the Vondelpark and about 10 minutes on the tram to the museums. The tram stop is very near. The apartment is fully equipped for self catering but there are lots of good local restaurants.  There is a lovely roof terrace which would be great in good weather and a spacious living area.  Lots of steep stairs but this is probably typical of all city apartments."
31080,195353194,2017-09-19,7022931,Melanie,"the location is ideal
20 minutes from the congress center and 15 minutes from the center of amsterdam

The flat is perfect for a stay in Amsterdam. Well located, clean and comfortable.
One of my best week end of the year !
Thanks for everything;"
41125,163462,2011-01-03,285989,Ed,Very well-furnished and spacious apartment that's very close to everything but tucked away in a very nice neighborhood. Fatih's a great host as well.
41125,183746,2011-02-17,364421,Jonathan,"Fatih's apartment is a fifteen to twenty minute walk from Amsterdam's central station and less than five minutes away from public transport so it is quite easy to arrive with luggage. 

The area in which it is situated has everything you need for a week or so in Amsterdam - excellent shops, supermarket and restaurants and a Saturday market two blocks away and it has the ambience of Amsterdam's canal culture. 

The apartment is very domestic - you will be basically walking into a well organised apartment and the living space is light and airy and, in winter, warm. With the exception of the small bathroom and a laundry alcove, the apartment is open plan; it has a terrific audio-visual system and wifi access; and the kitchen is easy to use.

I used Fatih's apartment as a home base while travelling to range of cities in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe and being so close to all forms of public transport was a real bonus. Fatih was an excellent and accommodating host.

41125,233062,2011-04-20,251119,Michael,"Fatih was a great host, and his place was set up exactly as described. Lots of space, clean, everything we needed. Also really liked the location. Close to everything but nice and quiet. Definitely recommend others to stay here if visiting Amsterdam. We didnt know anything about the city, but found the Jordaan neighborhood very charming, safe, and much more enjoyable than anything near city center. So many places to eat, drink, shop, and experience the city more like the locals do. Thanks Fatih!"
41125,270555,2011-05-19,455308,Alejandro,"Fatihs appartment is very good, the lacation is excellent. Jordan is better town in Amsterdam.
Also Fatih was very kindly whit us, when we had a problem with airlines and then we arrive in Amsterdam one day late, and he was flexible and fast to modify the reserve.
Thanks,

Alejandro Fainsod"
41125,290122,2011-05-31,403610,Elana,"This apartment is in an awsome part of the city. Close enough to walk every where or easily catch public transport, yet away from the hectic center. 

Beware that there are many stairs to this 3rd floor apartment and no lift - but we managed with our 14 month old son and a pram everyday. The benefits of the apartment definitely outweigh this one negative.

The apartment has contemporary styling, is open plan, bright and very spacious. There is a great flat screen set up. The kitchen is as-new and very easy to cook in. There are a couple of supermarkets a few minutes walk away. The free wifi was a bonus.

Fatih, the owner was very accommodating and friendly. We stayed 10 days and would definitely check availability of this apartment if we ever return to this beautiful city.

It was located in a nice quiet neighborhood, but not inconvenient for access to the heart of Amsterdam- only a 15 minute walk to Central Station. Fatih was a very accommodating host, and easy to contact whenever I needed anything.  I would definitely stay here again."
41125,351853,2011-07-04,681654,Terri,"Fatih is a very considerate host; he tried to help me get a hotel nearby because the apartment wasn't available for the first day I was in Amsterdam. Apartment is very clean, has all the amenities you need and is comfortably spacious. The location is fantastic! You can walk to the train station in 15 minutes, and many other parts of the city. Highly recommend."
41125,358309,2011-07-07,493811,Errol,"Great spot from which to wander and explore Amsterdam.  Clean and, most important of all, QUIET.  We would not hesitate to stay with Fatih again."
41125,496039,2011-09-02,386886,Avin,"Great apartment in a very attractive and central area. Close to everything. Bars,restaurants, market and several great supermarkets a few minutes walk away. The apartment is very tidy and clean and has everything you need and beyond. Amazing entertainment system with loads of movies to choose from which is perfect on  rainy days. Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back. Thank you to the very helpful host Fatih.  "
41125,508636,2011-09-06,1028601,Mira,"We didn't meet Fatih in person, but he was quick to respond to email and his friend let us in and explained the apartment details.The apartment is in the perfect location for walking around Amsterdam and yet still on a quiet and relaxing street. Plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops near by. It's nice and sunny on all side and there is plenty of space. The furnishing is modest and simple. The only imperfection is that the bathroom is very small and has no window. Besides that, it's perfect. We're staying there again on our return to Amsterdam."

41125,721988,2011-11-15,381795,Louis,"The apartment was awesome. We didn't get chance to meet Faith in person but his neighbors were very friendly and let us in when we arrived. Check-in and out times were flexible too so it worked out great for our flight times. The location is very convenient too, walkable from central station or you can take the bus (5 min ride on bus number 18 or 21 get off at nieuwe willemsstraat). The apt is very spacious too, it looks small in the photos but for the 2 of us the place felt huge lol. All mod cons are included and clear instructions were printed out for us to operate things like the tv and stuff. It's a great place to stay for exploring Ams or even if you just wanted to stay in and relax. The only thing that needs fixing though is the toilet flush which takes a long time to refill after flushing. Aside from that, perfect place :)"

It is just a short walk to all the main attractions. Neighborhood is charming with plenty of shops and restaurants to explore. I plan on staying here again the next time I visit! "
41125,4271026,2013-04-23,5600670,Michael,"In my opinion, this apartment is a far better option than the majority of hotel in Amsterdam. I gladly trade away hotel amenities for feeling like I have a true home while on vacation. The quality of this apartment is outstanding and Fatih is a great host. For a time I felt like an Amsterdam resident welcomed in the Jordaan neighborhood. "
41125,4359015,2013-04-30,3511776,Gerry,"We arrived on a cool day in Amsterdam with a load of bags. Luckilly Fatih's place is very close to Amsterdam Central station which is where our journey started. We took a local GVB bus from bus stop ""F"" at Amsterdam Centraal and were at our stop within 5 minutes. From there it was an easy walk to Fatih. He greeted us warmly, helped with the bags and showed us his lovely apartment. Everything as described in AirBnB. Spacious, light and airy rooms. We especially liked the kitchen supplies (utensils and some basic stuff like tea and coffee) - meant it really was living at home. The place is clean, very centrally located to all things including local transport.

Fatih was always there to take care of any needs and answer questions - a very gracious host.

Can really recommend his apartment and Fatih as a host.

Just be aware that it is on the 3rd floor so be prepared for stairs."

He was kind enough to let me check in before the stated check in time which made my life much easier! The apartment was SPOTLESS and well equipped and lacked nothing.  The area is off the beaten track but still close to the centre...The facilities were excellent and the AV facilities and wifi were second to none. Everything worked well and I would be pleased to go back to Fatih's apartment on my next trip to Amsterdam, it was a real home from home :)"

It was overlooking a quiet street in the front and a courtyard in the back.  The location was perfect because it wasn't too touristy yet still close to all attractions.  It was very quiet and a lovely area to wander around.
41125,18425853,2014-08-26,3105848,Alexandra,"Fatih's place in the Jordaan is in a wonderful location, close to amenities and cool hang-out spots. The apartment was clean, tidy and spacious - everything I could have asked for. He welcomed me in person, and even showed me how to use the espresso machine (!). Thanks Fatih for a fantastic stay in Amsterdam! "
41125,19168952,2014-09-07,20751572,Bert,"Really, a wonderful place for a stay in Amsterdam. I guess that everything is said about the appartment,  and I like to add that it is true. Fatih is a very friendly host, and we were delighted by his support and flexibility (as it is not usually in a touristic spot like Amsterdam). The Joordan area is really exiting, and we've found new places to stay. Anyhow, we would ask Fatih again to rent his appartment and hope that he agrees."
41125,20525230,2014-09-30,21290846,Vittorio,"Me and my girlfriend had the best time! The apartment was even better than it looked on site pic and it was clean with everything you can need during your trip. The location is just great, one of the best in Amsterdam. We didn't meet Fatih but he was very helpful and arranged everything for our arrival and stay. When we had a question his respond was really quick, before and during our stay. A special Hi to Fatih neighbor Stephan that welcomed us and explained everything. We'll certainly came back in Fatih flat next time we're in Amsterdam, if he'll host us again.  "

41125,24539158,2014-12-30,21043830,Gauthier,"Appartement très agréable dans quartier calme à environ 15 minutes du centre, cela se fait très bien dans cette ville.

Fatih n'ayant pas pu nous accueillir, c'est un de ses amis qui l'a fait, très sympa malgré notre petit retard le  jour de notre arrivée.
Je recommande, j'y retournerai volontiers. Fatih a été réactif lors de nos différents échanges.
Conseil: préparer votre itinéraire du parking à l'appart avant d'arriver sur place (choix de la ligne de bus ou tram) car sur place cela peut devenir compliqué."
41125,37517504,2015-07-07,19863019,Ankit,"We had the most amazing holiday, love the apartment & the area of course! Fatih was a wonderful host, prompt and helpful, specially with moving out bags 3 floors up! Wonderful experience overall. :) "

41125,73282085,2016-05-08,13806537,Todd,"Great apartment!  Great communication and help from Faith.  Apartment is even bigger in person than it looks in the pictures.  Very clean and well appointed.  Would stay again, absolutely."
41125,86672576,2016-07-17,34134373,Maria,"Fatih was a great host to us, and kindly explained to us anything we needed to know about the apartment. His place is perfectly situated, and enabled us to walk easily to anywhere we wanted to roam in the city. It is also very spacious and clean. I highly recommend staying at Fatih's!"
41125,92264849,2016-08-08,9987421,Mohamed,"The neighborhood is amazing, the appartment is spacious and clean and Fatih was really helpful. Would gladly come back."
41125,96177802,2016-08-22,83525819,Matthew,"Me and my girlfriend arrived for a long weekend, And fatih's apartment was definitely the place to stay. It was a lot bigger than the pictures do it justice. Would really recommend anyone to stay here, exceptional clean. "
41125,103016986,2016-09-20,14466884,Uğur,Lovely apartment! Fatih was very helpful and charming! 
41125,104328917,2016-09-26,36760051,Mohamed,"we couldn't meet Fatih when we checked in but he arranged everything through his friend who lives downstairs, so checked in was pretty smooth :). Fatih was so helpful with answering all our questions promptly on the phone. neighborhood was great, place was so clean and we had everything (and more :D) what we needed in the apartment. well done Fatih you are keeping a very good house, we felt like home :). i will definitely stay here on my next trip.
 "
41125,142257544,2017-04-07,18010465,Michael,Fatih's place is very centrally located and close to everything.  The area is hip and lively yet quiet at night.  It has everything you need for a long or short stay.  We enjoyed the fancy TV setup after a day of exploring Amsterdam.  Thanks again Fatih!
41125,143521064,2017-04-12,40948420,Thodoris,"Great place, almost at the center, in a very hip neighborhood of Amsterdam"
41125,168432450,2017-07-09,45099369,Mackenzie,"Fatih, we just loved your place and thank you for accommodating our late arrival. Your apartment was in a perfect location - not more than 10-15 minute walk to anything we wanted to see. The apartment itself is beautiful and perfect for a couple visiting Amsterdam. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area - we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
41125,222596787,2017-12-30,85818732,Joana,"El apartamento de Fatih nos gustó mucho, es tal como se muestra en las fotos (la cocina esta equipada, hay wifi, calefacción...). Esta situado en el barrio de Jordaan, un barrio tranquilo, agradable y seguro, a unos 15 minutos andando de la estación central.
Aunque no nos vimos personalmente con Fatih, nos dio toda la información por correo unos días antes y se preocupó de que quedase todo claro.
Recomendaría su apartamento sin duda!!"
41125,267912838,2018-05-23,100217139,James,"Faith was easy to communicate with and responded promptly. His place is as described and the neighborhood is perfect. Great food, low key, an absolute gem in Amsterdam. Would highly recommend to anyone."
41125,268856836,2018-05-26,6057977,Anton,"Our visit went according to plan, thank to the Fatih appartment. Good location, good price, good conditions."
41125,272198002,2018-06-03,15779443,Carl,"Such a great spot. The apartment was spacious, clean, and offered everything I could think of. The location is very central, I was able to walk to almost anything very easily."
41125,281068027,2018-06-24,82390089,Clinton,"Great location in Jordaan near all of the major sights, but in a laid back neighborhood.  Would definitely return."
41125,329579851,2018-09-29,67557173,Sharon,What is advertised is exactly what you get.  A great location close to everything
41125,331603045,2018-10-03,213318534,John,Great location In Amsterdam—walking distance to everything. And nice and quiet at night.
41125,333504350,2018-10-07,129666226,Alan,"What you see is what you get. Fatih is an excellent host and the house is perfect.
Cheers."
41125,367234863,2019-01-04,95677403,Jen,Great spot in an excellent location
41125,441878779,2019-04-22,67394011,Jp,"This is a great place to stay in Amsterdam! The Jordaan neighborhood was a perfect location to enjoy all Amsterdam has to offer. There are lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby, as well as grocery stores. It's only a 15 minute walk to Central Station and the red light district. It's about a 5 minute walk to Anne Frank's house.

The apartment was REALLY nice. We were very comfortable there for almost a week. We didn't cook as much as we thought we would because the food in the area was so good, but the kitchen had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the views of the neighborhood were like a scene from a movie.

The apartment is on the 3rd floor and the stairs are quite steep and narrow (typical of old buildings in Europe), so keep that in mind if you have a hard time getting around. The internet was a bit slower than we're used to, but it was adequate and I was able to upload videos to our YouTube channel.

We HIGHLY recommend staying at Fatih's place on your next trip to Amsterdam. You won't be disappointed."
41125,450048169,2019-05-08,52147941,Cassandra,Highly recommend. Accurate description. Great location and commutation.
41125,452839716,2019-05-14,164280777,Wiktoria,"Good location, clean and stylish"
41125,454430959,2019-05-18,160063038,Melissa,"Nice, spacious apartment. No one greeted us or offered to show us how things worked until the next day after we had figured most of it out but it was a nice place in a good location, looks like the photos. If you have mobility issues, there are 3 steep flights of stairs. Host was in another country but communicated well."
41125,457895764,2019-05-25,80043600,Déborah,Very nice flat. Quiet but close from everything
41125,462748324,2019-06-02,1568128,Lorin,The apartment was perfect and as shown.   Location was good being in the Jordaan section.  Easy check-in too.  Would stay here again given the opportunity.
41125,468406928,2019-06-12,72540852,Claudio,"Con Fatih la comunicacion fue muy fluida. La ubicacion del departamento es excelente, es un barrio tranquilo con bares y restaurantes.
Como todas las casas de Amsterdam no hay ascensor y las escaleras son estrechas, el departamento esta muy bien decorado, equipado y con todos los electrodomesticos que necesitas excepto secarropas
En resumen, muy recomendable"
41125,474451019,2019-06-23,2630756,Brian,Great place in walking distance from everything you want or need.  Clean and spacious.
41125,479567186,2019-07-01,148606414,Trina,"Our trip to Amsterdam was nothing short of amazing. Fatih's home made it even better. We were in a great location that felt safe and it was nice and quiet at night. His home was easy to find when we arrived. We never got to meet him personally, but he left us with really good instructions and his neighbor downstairs was friendly. We had a clean place and we especially liked the space in the bathroom. We had the basics needed for the week,  minus cooking oil and toilet paper, which we purchased at the market nearby. The steep stairs all the way to the third floor was quite the challenge at times, but I came back home with strong legs! 
Would recommend to anyone staying in Amsterdam. Thanks again Fatih!"
41125,484056269,2019-07-08,6592944,Vijay,Excellent location and really cozy apartment
42970,91484,2010-09-06,215478,Marion,Monique is a very friendly and the appartment is very well located ! closed to every touristic sites !
42970,94449,2010-09-10,223984,Hilde,"The studio is in a great part of Amsterdam. We were not able to spend the night because Monique had double-booked inadvertently. Fortunately, she had booked an excellent hotel room for us, and covered our breakfast, which came to the same price as the studio."
42970,97294,2010-09-14,228178,Matteo,"The studio was very clean and simply but elegantly furnished. The location is very central and convenient to major museums, the train station, bars and restaurants. "
42970,105450,2010-09-26,209842,Jessica,"Great location, very clean, newly renovated studio in the heart of Amsterdam. Monique was very nice and available for any help needed."
42970,108669,2010-09-30,218360,Jonathan,"Very cute, clean, and convenient - a pleasure to stay there. Monique also gave us a few tips about where to eat - the Indonesian place right downstairs is very good. One heads-up (although not a problem for us) - as with most places in Amsterdam, the stairs are very steep."
42970,127626,2010-10-26,184472,Deepak,"We stayed with Family of 3 , Great Experience, Excellent location. Monique was very prompt and helpful.Highly recommended.
Deepak"
42970,136303,2010-11-09,259908,Mariko,"Monique is a fabulous host.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Had no trouble picking up the keys on the first day.  The apartment is very clean, tranquil, stylish, fully equipped and SUPER central.  It's just close enough to the heart of the city, surrounded by nice little shops and places to eat and drink.  Monique had great restaurant and shop recommendations.  And she even helped arrange for a taxi on the day we left!

"
42970,137840,2010-11-12,135916,Avi,"The apartment is fantastic. It's in a great location, easily accessible by tram, in the heart of the city, and has a new bed and fixtures. Monique was very helpful. She arranged to have someone meet us when we showed up and when our plans changed she accommodated us by letting us shift the nights we were going to stay with her. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Amsterdam."
42970,141149,2010-11-18,265557,Jennifer,"Monique was wonderful!  She was friendly, responsive, and accommodating.  My husband and I loved the studio -- as the other reviewers mentioned, it's located in a very central part of town that allowed us to walk all over the city and was very accessible to Centraal Station.  The studio itself is super clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our five days in Amsterdam.  It was a very cozy spot and I'd definitely recommend Monique's place to friends."
42970,155641,2010-12-19,281847,Crystal,The studio was very clean and smelled lovely.  Definitely a great location.  Very central....easy walk to the various squares.  Would stay there again.  Monique was always helpful.  
42970,161468,2011-01-01,58525,Kevin,"We had a splendid time in Amsterdam due in no small part to Monique and the apartment she provided.  The bed was quite possibly the most comfortable I've ever slept on and the apartment has everything one might need.  The location is superb and puts you in the middle of the action, but is still a quiet and comfy retreat when you are ready to get your rest.  Monique was super accommodating even after some confusion and delays with our arrival time.  If you're visiting Amsterdam and need a place to stay and Monique's place is available I'd suggest you book immediately!"
42970,173688,2011-01-23,229701,Narayan,"the location is great, right in the heart of amsterdam, within walking distance of a lot of the interesting places in the city and conveniently located near tram lines if you want to explore further.

the room was warm and pleasant with an excellent bed, ample storage space, a nice kitchenette (including an espresso machine!), a nice hot shower, etc.  the washer-dryer upstairs came in handy.

one warning to people who haven't been inside a real dutch building: the stairs can be a huge challenge.  they're steep -- more like ladders than staircases."
42970,178005,2011-02-03,99416,Katie,"The apartment was beautiful and modern. Freshly cleaned, central to everything. We couldn't have asked for a better studio. Monique was fabulous, friendly and flexible with check-ins/outs, even when we decided to stay an additional night! I love Amsterdam, and the apartment was part of making my experience even better."
42970,202357,2011-03-18,277420,Syah,"Monique's apartment is beautiful. What we like most is the location, almost near to everything (few minutes walk to Madame Tussauds, cafes/restaurants etc). She also assisted us to book a taxi during our check out. Highly recommended!"
42970,208656,2011-03-25,424420,Zarah,"The Studio was just what we wanted - a cozy, clean and centrally located place to spend a few days in Amsterdam. Just off the Spui square and adjacent to the canal district and the Jordaan, the location was perfect! "
42970,226298,2011-04-14,431385,Cynthia,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and loved the location of our studio. It was very clean and comfortable and was surrounded by plenty of places to eat and walk to. Our host let us leave our luggage in the studio so that we could make the most of our last day without hauling our suitcase with us.  We would stay at Monique's again when we return....and we will return!
42970,229472,2011-04-18,316304,Rui,"Our stay in Monique's apartment was wonderful!  We stayed in the lower level studio - the equivalent of the second floor.  Even though, as many reviewers have noted, it's in a fabulous, central location, right by the tram line, restaurants, bars, and the Spui square, once the windows were closed, you couldn't hear too much noise.  The apartment and bathroom were clean and modern, and the shower had good water temperature and pressure.  The bed was heavenly, and having wi-fi was so convenient.  Highly recommended!  "
42970,234916,2011-04-22,392093,Dov,My wife and I were thrilled to find the apartment cozy and clean and right in the heart of Amsterdam! We could not have found a more perfect place to stay.
42970,249560,2011-05-03,395098,Cuauhtémoc,The apartment was wonderful and in a great location. Highly recommended!
42970,256133,2011-05-09,281829,Rebecca,"The apartment was great! Nice space. Awesome location - in the middle of everything. We went to bed between midnight and 2 am most nights, but if you want to get to sleep before that, it might be too noisy. Bed is AMAZING. Real king size bed in Europe. Such a luxury. Great wifi access and plenty of English channels on the TV. Thanks!"
42970,260830,2011-05-12,505811,Carlie,"Fantastic apartment , fit out with all the essentials.  We had the use of a washing machine and iron  - this was most welcomed as we had been travelling for a few weeks before arriving in Amsterdam.  We had 2 lovely hosts looking after us whilst Monique was on holidays, and they were most accommodating.  The location is fantastic and central to food, bars and shopping.  The tram stop is just around the corner.  I would recommend Monique's apartments to compliment  your stay in Amsterdam."
42970,269254,2011-05-18,467034,Anne,"This studio is absolutely great.  Great location.  Incredibly comfortable bed.  Instant how water.   Cute, cute cute.  Monique was great to deal with.  Though she was out of the country during our visit, she made sure to have her friends available for us to check in.  She also allowed us to check in early, since noone else was there the morning of our arrival.  This was great, since we flew all night from the U.S.  

The location is really great.  It's a busy street with alot of hopping restaurants and bars, but the windows do a really good job of keeping out the noise.  The stairs up are steep and narrow, which might be a problem for some.  

Awesome place that I would highly recommend.  It's great to have a little frig and equipment for making tea, etc.  We were able to visit the markets and take picnics with us, since we had a refrigerator available.  "
42970,275911,2011-05-23,419121,Libor,"We highly recommend this place. The apartment is in a great location - right in the city centre and easy walking distance to all major tourist attractions. Inside the apartment was very clean, there was a small kitchenette and also Nespresso coffee machine, which we thought was a great touch as we are big on good quality coffee! Monique was very prompt to respond to our queries.
"
42970,295625,2011-06-03,440846,Laura,"great place, great host, great city.
monique greeted us with beers and was super friendly. the studio was just what we needed, and we had a great time in amsterdam. thumbs up "
42970,301671,2011-06-07,69987,Dawn,"We really enjoyed our stay at Monique's. It was clean, warm, nicely furnished, and the location was excellent (it was very easy to get around town and there are loads of really good shops and places to eat nearby).

The stairs are steep, but as we were on the first floor there weren't that many to negotiate.

The bed was particularly comfortable and the shower was great too. We'd definitely stay again!"
42970,325917,2011-06-21,172308,Michael,The place was amazing.  Very clean and in a fantastic location.  Highly recommended!
42970,336677,2011-06-27,350622,Clarice,The location is very good and the studio was super clean. I would definitely recommend.
42970,364241,2011-07-10,686054,Lyn,"Thank you Monique for a warm welcome & a home away from home stay!  Was such a great location, so central to everything. The only down side in the summer was not being able to open the windows at night without loads of street noise however we were provided with a fan and were more than happy to substitute a little warmness for a great stay. Other bonuses were super dooper shower, comfy bed and plenty space to lounge with free WIFI! We'll be back!"
42970,374537,2011-07-15,758388,Christina,"truly great location, 5th visit to amsterdam in the past 2 years and it was by far the best place i have stayed. a great price and comfortable place, including the bed. clean and friendly :)"
42970,400416,2011-07-27,672509,Marta,"This studio was right in the center of the town - very popular pubs across the street.  Perfect location for going out on the town!  It was clean and comfortable.  But, since it did not seem as though anyone lived there on a day to day basis, it did not have all the amenities of a home.  A small kitchenette if you felt like staying in - but really, this place is better if you plan on eating out.  The major plus for this studio is it's central location!  It is on the metro line and is right in the middle of town.  A good place from which to explore the city.   "
42970,406646,2011-07-30,783560,Chris,"Monique is wonderful!  She not only helped me bring in one of my equipment cases (NASA-sized) but she also brought me a nice cold drink when I arrived.  The studio apartment is perfect for one or two people.  The location is central and close to everything ... especially my favourite neighborhood, Jordaan.

If you can't find suitable restaurants here this apartment, you're blind.

Thoroughly enjoyed staying here a few days and look forward to the next time!"
42970,415640,2011-08-02,830773,Anthony,"Pretty hard to beat this location, and Monique is very nice and helpful. The place was spotlessly clean, and very comfortable. We will be back."
42970,422538,2011-08-05,899114,Gunnar,"Great atmosphere and very good located in the middle of the city.
Just getting a bike and exploring the city is the best you can do!"
42970,436106,2011-08-11,542283,Fred,"This was a great location as it is centrally located.  We stayed for six nights.  We visited the VanGogh Museum, The Anne Frank Huis, FOAM, Te Heineken Experience, Vondel Park, Rembrandtplein, Amstelplein, West Market, North Market, took a canal tour, visited smoke shops, bars and restaurants and never used any public transportation.

Monique was available to lend information if we needed it."
42970,446609,2011-08-15,521818,Jonathan,"Great location and a wonderful, clean room.  The bed was so nice we're going to buy one just like it when we get home.

The stairs are very steep - almost a ladder, so if you have lots of or very heavy luggage, be sure to plan ahead for help.  

The neighborhood is lively so be ready to enjoy it.  Local transportation is very convenient.  "
42970,456660,2011-08-18,714634,Chris And Dawn,Monique's studio is incredibly comfortable.  The bed is more comfortable than my own bed.  The location is perfect...walking distance to all the major squares and with plenty of nice restaurants just outside your door.  I highly reccommend!
42970,486978,2011-08-30,690549,Tom,"Monique's apartment was in a great location. It was easy to get to and close to all the sights in Amsterdam. The apartment was exactly as pictured and had everything we needed. Monique provided us with maps, guide books and recommendations of place to visit. We look forward to returning soon."
42970,517165,2011-09-10,191815,Carla,"Monique was a wonderful and welcoming host. The room was lovely and comfortable, with all the amenities we needed and in a fantastic location. We really enjoyed our stay! "
42970,545431,2011-09-19,935704,Thomas,We are very pleased with the airbnb process and facilities. We would use airbnb again when we travel. The apartment in Amsterdam was excellent and its location was superb. We had easy access to all the sights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
42970,576399,2011-09-27,1023918,Mark,The host canceled my reservation 8 days before arrival.
42970,577182,2011-09-28,611938,Adrian,Great location. Enjoyed people watching from the windows!
42970,582900,2011-09-30,246053,Susan,"Absolutely amazing clean, modern apartment in center of Amsterdam.  We had everything we needed - espresso machine, kitchen & sitting area all in a studio apt in a great location.  And as others have reviewed - very comfortable bed indeed!  Monique is a fantastic host and when she wasn't available she had other people to also take care of us.  We arrived quite a bit earlier than expected and everything was still ready and someone was there to meet us which we greatly appreciated.  I adore the 9 Streets area (the SOHO of Amsterdam) and we were within a minute walk.  I would recommend this place to any traveller going to Amsterdam, and i plan to stay here again the next time I visit."
42970,622555,2011-10-12,899909,Tony,"Monique was a great host, spending quality time with us over a glass of wine to ensure we made the most of our time in Amsterdam.

The apartment is clean, comfortable and in a great part of town.

There's a tram stop (Spui) around the corner and the area features all types of restaurants, great fashion and antique shopping as well as easy access to the Jordan and parks.

We have no hesitation in recommending Moniqueand her accommodation."
42970,644193,2011-10-18,1234100,Jason,"The apartment was as close to perfect as I could imagine! I stayed on the second floor studio. Really was exactly what I was looking for on my stay. Primarily private and CLOSE to the canals. It itself is exceptionally charming. Spacious, clean and attractive. Thank you Monique. 
The only things I feel would be helpful to notify people of is that its in a shared building with her personal home, which made me want to be cautious of noise. And also that the steps to each level (which by the way I think is the most charming part of the stay) are so steep they're close to ladders, which may be difficult for some. 
I've already recommended it to other friends!"
42970,666517,2011-10-26,1227627,Steve,Monique was a lovely host. She made my girlfriend and i feel very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay at her studio very much. We love Amsterdam and we found her place to be very convenient. Her studio was impeccably clean and well taken care of. It actually looks much better in person than it does online. I would recommend her studio to anyone who wants to stay in the heart of the city for a very reasonable rate. 
42970,681377,2011-11-01,531785,Nikos,"We visited Amsterdam with my wife for our newlywed trip. Monique's lovely little studio was just perfect. We had the chance to choose between the two (similar, as we were told) available studios, but we chose the first floor one without seeing the other, since it was perfect already.

For our main concern (seeing the most of Amsterdam in 5 days) it was excellent: Superb location so we could have everything near, fast and reliable internet connection (so we can get info / book tickets etc) and a variety of maps/guides offered in the room.

It was also very nicely decorated, very comfortable (wait till you lie on that bed) and very clean.

It's definitely what we'll choose if we visit again and we couldn't recommend it more."
42970,729972,2011-11-19,1117023,Luisa,"What a great holiday in Amsterdam for my brother and his girlfriend! Monique is an amazing host, very kind and helpful. Her apartment is perfect, very comfortable, very clean and full of optionals... it is very close to the main attractions of the city."
42970,739590,2011-11-23,1215114,Connie,Monique is fabulous! The studio wonderful and the best bed EVER!!!! Great location! 
42970,780575,2011-12-12,1400197,Kelly,"Wonderful, centrally located apartment! Everything is within a 15 minute walk of here. Monique was incredibly hospitable and even invited us up to her apartment for some beers and cheese.
When we make our way back to Amsterdam, we will absolutely stay here again. I can't say enough good things about it!"

We would not hesitate to stay here again if we are in Amsterdam, there are great restaurants nearby, and public transport is just a few steps away if you want to head to another area. Be sure to try the Indonesian restaurant downstairs from the Studio, the food and service was awesome.

The kitchen was great for making our breakfast, so the pod based coffee machine was great. The available washer & dryer was great as well, it was nice to leave without a bunch of dirty laundry.

As other have said here, the bed is REALLY comfortable, better than ever expected.

Hope to see Monique again someday.

 

"
42970,805452,2011-12-25,1408526,Danny,"What can I say other than, OUTSTANDING!

Monique was a gracious host who welcomed us, offered guidance, and provided one of the most positive experiences during our 2 weeks staying in 5 countries.

The apartment looks like the photos posted and the location is superb.  The windows will not only keep the place warm, but the noise from outside is kept to a minimum for bed time.  Speaking of the bed - it is VERY comfortable - so much so, that we are buying the same bed for back home!

There is plenty of room for you to unpack your luggage, put things in the closet, seating for two for a meal, and great a great coffee machine :)

I couldn't ask for a better place in Amsterdam!"
42970,814596,2011-12-30,628338,Tati,"Studio was light, clean, comfortable and centrally located. Monique herself was a lovely and helpful host. "
42970,819590,2012-01-01,879743,Dave,"My fiancee and I just spent a holiday weekend in Amsterdam and booked a room at Monique's B&B through AirBnb. It was our first time using AirBnb but Monique was very communicative over email after we booked with her, answered all of our questions and made herself very available the first day we were there to make sure we got settled nicely. She had guidebooks of the city, a couple of the good local attraction pamphlets (check out the boat tour, great start to a trip and only about an hour, do it at dusk.)

Her flat is dead in the middle of where you want to be, without being on Dam Square with all the hustle and tourists. It's also across the street from what we thought was the best coffeeshop in Amsterdam, Tweede Kamer. Around the corner was an awesome Indonesian noodle place that was quick and delicious for refueling meals during partying/touristing.

Monique had two sets of keys (which was great) and the bed was definitely a Tempur-pedic which I had never slept on before and was supremely comfortable. I'm looking forward to booking with Monique again in the spring/summer as its my new favorite city (knocking out Reykjavic). "
42970,857044,2012-01-11,1532534,Andoni,great place to stay in amsterdam!

From contact before booking to check out!
Amazing"
42970,929772,2012-02-18,1704462,Leah,"We have to admit, we were a bit shocked when we opened the door to Monique's apartment building to find the very steep and narrow traditional Dutch staircase staring at us. But once we conquered our fear, we found that the room was worth the climb! An adorable place! Extremely clean and well decorated. Very nice, modern appliances and furnishings, with a touch of Dutch charm as well. Monique was very friendly and accommodating. She offered great advice on restaurants and places to see. You could tell she was extremely organized and thorough - and I loved all of her special added touches, right down to the festive ribbon keychain! Say hello to the cats that hang out in the shop next door. One is ALWAYS there, snoozing in the window. Very nice espresso machine that we utilized - washer and dryer worked great. Location was perfect - VERY close to the Tram  and in a lovely area. I really can't do it justice - you just have to stay there and see for yourself. Even the stairs turned out to be part of its charm. We would DEFINITELY stay there again and recommend it to anyone! "
42970,966834,2012-03-03,1732284,Stephanie,"This is an absolutely lovely place to stay if you have the opportunity to visit Amsterdam. The apartment is so cute and very clean (and this is coming from someone with notoriously exacting standards). Set up as a real, small apartment, it is nice to relax in after spending a day out walking around. The bed was so comfortable my boyfriend and I had to make quite the effort to get ourselves out of it! However, visiting the popular attractions from the apartment was nearly effortless thanks to its very central location. Transit time did not exceed much over 15 minutes to get anywhere (and we walked most places). Also very easy to get to and from the train station, very close to the tram. Lastly, the host Monique is completely lovely, so pleasant and nice. She popped in to say hello and make sure we were enjoying ourselves a few times, and was very helpful with recommendations of places to eat and drink. And the quite literal icing on the cake was that she brought Matt and I two big chocolate brownies on the morning of my birthday! Very nice, would definitely recommend to anyone!"
42970,972722,2012-03-05,1773012,Violaine,"Very nice and cute studio, very clean! The studio is perfectly located in the centre. The studio is on street side surrounded by restaurants, thus a bit noisy. 
We had a great stay and I definitely recommend this place."
42970,1008145,2012-03-17,1817700,Davide And Elen,"This was my first booking through Airbnb and I could have not be happier.
Fantastic location, short distance from District 9, the vintage chic quartier in Amsterdam and away from the tourists traps.
The studio was also perfect in size, clean, bright and with a handy Nespresso machine to start your day in the perfect way.
Monique is very kind and welcoming making the stay even better.
I will definetely be back next time I am in Amsterdam.
Davide"
42970,1024173,2012-03-20,1800889,Marifae,"This studio was perfect. The location was ideal, located close to the tram, shops, and restaurants. And Monique was such a warm, accomodating host. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Amsterdam."
42970,1042112,2012-03-25,777172,Ole,"Monique has a great studio in central Amsterdam. It's a perfect location and Monique is super easy to deal with and a great host. The studio itself is modern, practically furnished and is comfortable. I would definitely recommend to stay here!"

Monique is a wonderful host and her studio is the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam.  The location is great.  And the space is extremely comfortable.  The bed is amazing.  The decor is beautiful.  And the studio feels like home away from home.  I'm already planning my next trip to Amsterdam.  My only hope is that Monique's studio is available when I return."
42970,1100714,2012-04-09,501355,Neus,"Very nice location in the heart of Amsterdam! No need to take the tram, wherever you'd like to go it's in a walking distance. Very clean and comfortable studio."
42970,1117665,2012-04-12,1514481,Nicholas,"Location is superb. Extremely near to all the action, neighborhood is bustling with activity as well. Restaurants and cafes everywhere, just a 5 mins tram ride from Amsterdam Central. Place was clean, and Monique was extremely helpful throughout as well."

42970,1166329,2012-04-23,1585079,Katrin,"Hallo,

wir waren begeistert von dem Zimmer. Monique ist eine tolle Gastgeberin.

Falls wir mal wieder nach Amsterdam fliegen, dann sofort wieder zu Monique.

"
42970,1214377,2012-05-02,1210490,Antonio,Awesome place.. and the bed!! We simply loved it!!!
42970,1256843,2012-05-10,1137050,Danielle,"Monique's place was perfect, it is close to the main train station, lots of little cafes and resturants, 2 supermarkets within walking distance and around the corner from the tram. The apartment its self was perfect, kitchen is small and basic but had everything we needed to make breakfast every morning and a few quick meals.

The winner for me was by far the bed and pillows, better then what we have at home and saying goodbye to the bed was the hardest part of leaving Amsterdam!

We found it to be in a good location, its about a 10-15 walk to the red light district and only one tram stop to the really upmarket area of Amsterdam, we liked the location as the main tourist part of Amsterdam is pretty full on and a little seedy, it was nice to come back to a more classy part of town.

Monique is super friendly, eager to help and likes a chat about how your stay is going. I would highly recommend her and her facilities to anyone visiting Amsterdam and we wouldn't bother look at any other place other then Monique's if we came back to Amsterdam."
42970,1265361,2012-05-12,1698242,Whitney,"Fantastic, clean and modern room in a great part of town.  I was afraid of the noise of being over a restaurant, but the windows kept all the noise out!  Love the bed.  Monique took very good care of us and made sure we had everything we needed.  Hope to come back in the future and would reccomend for anyone looking for a great place in Amsterdam.  "
42970,1354750,2012-05-27,1581232,Jonathan,The apartment was just as great as advertised.  Excellent location to walk to most local attractions and close to the train stop.  Bed was VERY comfortable.  I will recommend Monique to anyone who heads that way!
42970,1405338,2012-06-03,2185274,Matt,This is an exceptional flat in a great location in central Amsterdam.  Monique was a great host -- even went out of the way to print a couple of documents for me.  Five stars all the way.
42970,1456675,2012-06-11,452903,Michelle And Chad,"Wonderful apartment.  And amazing location.  Our time at Monique's studio was fantastic, her communication was very reliable, and the ease of location was unbeatable.  Thanks for the great experience.  If we're in Amsterdam again, we'll definitely re-book w/ Monique.  "
42970,1483469,2012-06-15,1282580,Erin,"We loved staying in Monique's studio! The location is absolutely PERFECT- honestly could not have picked a better place myself.  The room is very clean, stylish, and very comfortable! Monique is very nice and was really easy to get in touch with. I would highly recommend staying here if you want the perfect experience in Amsterdam! "
42970,1527640,2012-06-21,928912,Sandy,"Had a great stay at Monique's place. The studio was very central and easy to get to/ from the airport. A lot of shopping, restaurants and grocery stores in walking distances.  Monique was easy to reach during the stay. "
42970,1554208,2012-06-25,1806246,Karlie,"OMG this apartment was just perfect!!!!! Most comfortable bed, great facilities. Loved it. We will definatley be staying there again. Monique was a great host, friendly and very helpful. The stairs are a little scary but you get used to them. Great apartment in the best location. We had the best time in Amsterdam and Monique's apartment played a big role in our awesome trip. "
42970,1607845,2012-07-02,1732488,Robert,"Monique is a very friendly and welcoming host. Her apartment was very nice, with added features like the coffee machine, which made the visit very comfortable. The bed was great! Just what you need for a relaxing sleep. Finally, we were very impressed by the location, which puts you within easy access to local clubs, cafes, and museums. Strongly recommended,"
42970,1661750,2012-07-09,1744553,Julia,"Great location, in the middle of Amsterdam in a cute Bed&Breakfast. Thanks for the nice stay and we'll see us again next year! :)"
42970,1707570,2012-07-14,1847813,Bert,"Nice B&B, close in the touristic centre. Nice bed, good coffee & great shower. As we were there for professional purposes the only disadvantage was the noise outside although this didn't bother us much as it stops at 1 and it isn't too loud. Monique is a very nice host !"
42970,1837785,2012-07-30,2443556,Elena,"Monique is very nice,  friendly and welcoming host.  The location is  perfect in the center of Amsterdam. The studio is great! A lot of shopping and wondeful restaurants near. Perfect bed  and of coffee. I recommend to stay only here!)"

The apartment is so well situated to everything, restuarants, bars, shopping and tourist sites, and we had a great time staying there.  We'd happily come back again.  Monique was great with her help and cheerful presence during our stay."
42970,2036414,2012-08-20,1910512,Sebastian,"The studio is a great place to stay at and start exploring the beautiful city of Amsterdam. Situated right in the middle of everything it ´s super easy for guests to just get out of the door and walk to most of the touristic highlights. Plus bars, cafés and restaurants all around. 

Monique is a lovely host who helps with everything one needs. There is just nothing to complain about. Happy times in Amsterdam! "
42970,2079236,2012-08-24,458010,Erin,"Monique is a very friendly host. She's quick to respond to your questions and eager to help and make your stay at her B&B as pleasant as possible. Her studio is in a fantastic, central location in Amsterdam and is surrounded by restaurants and cafes. It's a safe area as well with many conveniences (tram station, grocery store, etc.) nearby. We walked everywhere (Dam Square, Museumplein, Vondelpark, etc) and could do so in about 20 mins. Other highlights are: the extremely fast wifi, the comfortable bed and nespresso machine. The drawback we had was having to carry our heavy luggage up two flights are stairs so steep that they were practically like a ladder! We're younger and have smaller feet but I imagine it could be a challenge for more elderly guests or men with giant feet trying to get up the narrow steps! Nevertheless, I would stay here again because Monique is a respectful and reliable host that I can recommend!"
42970,2144621,2012-08-30,1213054,Marco,"The location can't be better. Monique was a great host, she gave us very good information."
42970,2156853,2012-09-01,2007467,Karin,"I loved this place and Monique. The whole process through AirBnB was super easy as well. This studio was the perfect size and was quite comfy. It gave you the sense you were living there considering you could go out and do stuff but then walk back and dump your stuff off, use the restroom, have a drink, do some emailing, freshen up and head back out again. Also considering it is in the center of everything, you can walk in any direction find something find to get into to.

Monique is lovely and very helpful. My trip was broken up into two stays with her because I took off to another town to visit family so she was so kind as to let me leave my massive suitcase with her on the property so I didnt have to lug it down the steep stairs. She is just nice to work with and very friendly. The kind of person you just want to give flowers to....which I did.

I miss my little Amsterdam apartment. I'm on being back next year!

Dank je wel Monique!"
42970,2306877,2012-09-17,2903991,Jerah,"Monique's apartment is great, and very close to everything. It was very clean, and the bed very comfortable!

She provides all the information a tourist would need to see sights in Amsterdam. "
42970,2359030,2012-09-21,1933915,Ashley,"Monique was a wonderful host and we had such a great time in Amsterdam.  The apartment is centrally located to anywhere you want to visit and we found ourselves walking around everywhere!  The bed is super comfy and the apartment itself is very clean.  There was another couple below us, and we never heard them!  The washer and dryer was a big bonus too!  If we ever find ourselves back in Amsterdam, we will definitely stay at Monique's again and I would recommend her apartment to any of my friends who are wanting to visit the area.  "

42970,2732443,2012-10-27,3783815,Mónica,Monique gave us very clear references to arrive to her place. Location is wonderful and we really found ourselves very comfortable in Amsterdam. Thank you Monique!
42970,2842568,2012-11-09,2013699,Estela,"Great location!!! in front of nice restaurants (Luxemburg) and great bars (Hoppe), walking distance to museums, flower market, jordaan, and the central station is a 10 min walk.  
The apartment is VERY clean, cozy and comfortable just how you see it in the pictures, loved our stay there this will be our first choice when we return to Amsterdam.  
Monique is very friendly and very easy to reach, she was really fast to answer phone calls and emails; since our train was leaving a little while after checking out she even gave us a place to leave our luggage for that time. 
Thank you Monique! "
42970,2987247,2012-11-28,3988016,Paolo,"Abbiamo trascorso un week-end lungo di solo relax. Sono diversi anni che torniamo ad Amsterdam per gustarci l'atmosfera pre-nataliza. Quest'anno abbiamo scelto la zona di Spui per girovagare tra le librerie internazionali (spirito) ed i pub accoglienti (corpo) per un ottima birra (sicuramente Hoppe e il Brabant). E' il primo anno che scegliamo la sistemazione in appartamento e da Monique ci siamo trovati ottimamente, grande accoglienza, ottima sistemazione, semplice, pulita."
42970,3060642,2012-12-11,3392394,Florent,"A beautiful flat in a beautiful city ! Everything was perfect during our stay.
Thanks for all Monique"
42970,3096981,2012-12-16,345386,Peter,Monique was a very gracious and warm host. She took the time to chat with me and share her Amsterdam recommendations. The space is excellent and the location superb! I highly reccomend. It is also very clean and modern. 
42970,3115288,2012-12-18,4341394,Raúl,"A lovely apartment and a perfect place to visit amsterdam! Thanks for your hospitality Caro and Monique, we will back soon!

42970,3262645,2013-01-04,3962879,Sophie,The apartment is very clean and comfortable and comes with everything you will need for a short stay in Amsterdam (aside from a hairdryer). It is in a great location with plenty of restaurants and shops on the same street. A 15 minute walk or short tram ride into Dam Square. The host was very hospitable and assisted us with everything we needed and was very quick to respond via email which was much appreciated. Would definitely stay there again!
42970,3412658,2013-01-25,2301277,Chelsea,Monique has the perfect apartment in the perfect location and was a perfect host. We arrived a dash late but nothing was an issue for Monique. She lugged all our luggage up the super steep staircase and made sure we were comfortable and all our needs were met. 
42970,3510899,2013-02-10,3529778,Gijs,Monique thank you for hosting  Deniz 
42970,3573296,2013-02-18,4467044,Josef,"Fantastically awesome. Super-clean, amazing location, and the neighbourhood and the house itself has loads of character. All the little details make this a superb place to stay. The Nespresso machine, the lonely-planet book (I forgot to buy mine), restaurant-tips not to mention the friendly and relaxed host. When the wifi was down, Monique fixed it in 10 minutes, and our contacts, arrival and checkout were completely hassle-free.
Warmly recommended."
42970,3635760,2013-02-26,5077624,Margaret,"Highly recommended!

This is the perfect studio apartment in the perfect location.  This place is cozy, warm, and the perfect size for a couple.  The bed is very comfortable and the whole building is kept very clean.  The free WiFi was very reliable. 

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a blow-dryer available for use as well, since I was coming from outside the EU and my personal blow-dryer wouldn't have been compatible with the electrical outlets in Amsterdam. 

Monique's B&B is centrally located, making it easy for us to walk to every attraction in the city within 10-20 minutes.  This was great because we could easily make pitt stops back at the apartment to warm up (it was a really cold and snowy weekend when we were there), shower, change clothes, etc.  This was great because we didn't feel like we had to carry a whole bunch of stuff around with us all day and made our trip very efficient, yet relaxing.  

Monique was very warm and welcoming, making us tea upon check-in and offering to make dinner reservations for us.  She also had travel books and had reviewed her favourite spots in a binder.  We really appreciated how flexible she was with check-in/check-out times.

We will definitely stay here again if we travel back to Amsterdam.  Thanks for everything, Monique!"
42970,3894342,2013-03-25,1385437,Julia,"Very friendly contact from beginning till end. And the studio couldn't be in a better location! Having said that, there are a lot of bars around and people might stand outside singing and shouting quite late. Would definitely go back there."
42970,3970960,2013-04-01,2642450,Gavin,"Perfect sounds like hyperbole, but exactly what we were looking for
Central, light, clean, warm, wifi, very cold fridge, good shower, windows down one side of the flat, up to date guidebook of Amsterdam, Nespresso machine that worked.
Came back more relaxed than I've been in over a year. Thanks - already thinking about when we can go back"
42970,4062013,2013-04-07,4704794,Hugo Y Marcela,"El studio está en una excelente ubicación, sobre la calle Spuistraat, a pasos del mercado de flores, la Plaza Spui (llena de bares y restaurantes), cerca de la Plaza Dam y de la mayoría de las atracciones en Amsterdam. Totalmente recomendable por la ubicación, por la limpieza, y los detalles como las flores y frutas que hacen a la decoración. Excelente atención de Monique, muy atenta a todo lo que uno necesita., así como también muy flexible con los horarios de entrada y salida. Sin duda volveríamos a su departamento."
42970,4265819,2013-04-23,4269098,Paige,"We arrived at Monique's apartment after long flight delays and lost luggage.  It wasn't the best start to our stay in Amsterdam, however, Monique gave us a warm welcoming complete with a refreshing drink.  She also offered to assist with our lost luggage issue by advising us to give the airline her contact details.
Monique is a friendly and helpful host - nothing was a bother.  Her apartment is bright, clean and has most of the amenities you will need for a short stay, including basic cooking and washing facilities.  The large bed was ultra comfortable.  We were a little surprised by the steep stairs to the apartment, however this seems common in Amsterdam properties.  We did get used to them but less agile people may find them a problem.  The location of the apartment is fantastic with plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby.  It felt like a lively yet safe area to stay and on a sunny day it's nice to sit on the windowsill and watch the action below.  We highly recommend Monique and her apartment and we would be happy to stay there again!"

The apartment is clean, bright, lovingly furnished and right in the center, surrounded by lovely bars, cafés, restaurants and shops. We would definitely go back there. Thank you Monique!"
42970,4531746,2013-05-11,1970288,Cecile,"What a pleasant journey we had in Amsterdam !! Monique's place is just perfect to visit the city, just right dowtown Amsterdam, in a lovely street, nearby Spui. Easy to find, easy to reach from Amsterdam Centraal with the tramway. Monique did everything to make us feel at ease, and her studio was a comfortable and lovely cocoon to us. As beautiful as the pictures let know… No need to tell more about the bed, the previous guests just said right. Highly recommended, don't hesitate any further !"
42970,4604052,2013-05-14,3494245,Jaimie,"We had a brilliant time staying at Monique's apartment in Amsterdam, the location was amazing with loads of lovely restaurants and bars nearby, and it was really easy to get around the city from there.

42970,4727044,2013-05-22,5292102,Julie,"We stayed in Monique's studio for 3 nights and absolutely loved it. The room is beautiful and the bed is so large and comfortable that we had a hard time leaving. Also the location is perfect for all the sights in the city, we even walked to vondelpark and it only took about 20 minutes. It's also very close to the train station which was very convenient for us. 

Thank you Monique, we really enjoyed meeting you and staying here. "
42970,4776590,2013-05-25,2303916,Monika,"We really enjoyed the staying in Monique´s apartment, which is centrally located in the city center of Amsterdam. Most can be reached on foot or by tram, which travels just a few meters away.
Restaurants, cafés, bakeries and many fine bookstores give the street a very authentic atmosphere.

And best of all: After a busy day of sightseeing you can recovering very well in the comfortable large bed in Monique's studio. Just wonderful! 
Monique is a very friendly and helpful host. She gave us a very good tip for a special restaurant and has also taken the booking for us. 
Thank you Monique!

We'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

42970,4959928,2013-06-04,3146465,Irene,"I had a wonderful stay in Monique's apartment. It is clean, bright and cheerful and a wonderful place to return to after a day of walking in Amsterdam. The location is perfect. It is close to everything. The street is busy as there are many restaurants on it and it can be loud at night. However, the windows are double-glazed and they cut down on the noise a lot when closed, so that is not a problem. Monique was very helpful during my stay. I would definitely stay here again."
42970,5013889,2013-06-07,6627432,Alysson,"We loved staying at MNQUE B&B.  My husband and I took our honeymoon in Europe.  We began and ended the trip staying in Monique's apartments.  They were both clean and adorable!  You have everything you need with a little kitchen, super comfortable bed, and clean and modern bathroom.  Monique even left fresh fruit and peonies!  Monique was a lovely host--friendly and helpful.  The apartment is really in the best location.  It is within walking distance to everything:  Leidseplein, Dam Square, the red light district, Jordaan, Ann Frank's House, and Museumplein.  The Nine Streets shopping area is great and just a block or so away.  If you don't like to walk, there is also a cable car right outside in Spui Square.  There are nice bars and restaurants surrounding the apartment and the double paned windows kept out the noise.  I would definitely recommend MNQUE B&B to family and friends.  "

42970,5228367,2013-06-19,6081723,Eric,"We stayed in Monique's first floor studio.  It was clean, bright, and modern.  One of the things we miss when we travel is the comfort of our own bed.  Not so at Monique's.  The bed was so comfortable.  The apartment is ideally located.  We walked everywhere.  There is a fabulous tapas restaurant next door, a delightful Italian restaurant, a bistro, and bakery all across the street.  Monique is very friendly and helpful.  We absolutely loved Amsterdam.  If we are able to return someday, we would definitely stay at Monique's again."
42970,5330471,2013-06-24,6538399,Elya,"We didn't managed to see Monique more than five minutes while we were staying in her apartment, but before and after the reservation she was helpful and kind. We had a great time in Amsterdam thanks to the location of the apartment, that is in the center of all that you would like to see here. The room was nice and pleasant exactly like in the pictures, and we slept amazing in this divine bed!!! 
We recommend Monique apartment from the bottom of our hearts :)))

42970,5555837,2013-07-06,5697909,Lisa,"Monique offers a fabulous neat room in an extremely convenient location to many walking distance attractions as well as trams. Also well located for various restaurants and bars, whatever your speed. Lovely decor and amenities. As this was our first ever Airbnb stay, Monique set the bar quite high!"
42970,5748310,2013-07-15,2344063,Rori,"Love, love, love Monique's B&B! The location was perfect - I was able to walk from the flat to anywhere I wanted to go. The room was immaculate and tastefully appointed, and there were fresh flowers waiting for me on the table. The bed is heavenly, and at night I just closed the windows and all was quiet.

I had great coffee every morning just across the street, and I had my choice of good places to eat, all nearby.

But best of all, Monique is a superb hostess! She was warm and friendly, helpful and receptive to my needs. I would stay there again  without question. I highly recommend Monique's B&B1

42970,5884850,2013-07-21,6450908,Emily,"Monique's apartment was the perfect spot for our stay in Amsterdam. Very central, and in a great neighbourhood. Very clean. Monique was a very welcoming host, and very helpful with tips about the city. We look forward to visiting again."
42970,6011342,2013-07-26,2884238,Jennifer,I come to Amsterdam frequently for work and was fed up with the hotel experience in Amsterdam. This is the first time I've booked with Monique and the experience was impeccable. She takes lovely care of her flat AND her clients. I was very comfortable and loved the perfect proximity to just about everything and the creature comforts of being 'home'  even when I wasn't. Nothing like a morning coffee with the nespresso machine (capsules included)  while watching the day begin. Will be back again - no doubt! :-D 
42970,6108248,2013-07-30,4915031,Tanya,"Great location, no street noise, comfy bed.
Recommend thanks"
42970,6490241,2013-08-14,1795762,Vika,"Monique was great and checked in on us to make sure we were comfortable and that everything was ok. We LOVED staying at this little apartment. It was clean, bright, and centrally located in a safe and lively part of town. There are restaurants and bars steps away. Perfection!"
42970,6616322,2013-08-19,5726596,Manjesh,"We stayed at Monique's for 3 nights in Aug '13. The place is very easy to find and close to the train station. There are a lot of restaurants and bars in the area. Monique is very helpful - she helped us with recommendations, train reservations and generally. The apartment is comfortable, but has a couple of drawbacks - there is only one dresser to store clothes. The other drawback is that the apartment is on a busy street - the bars can get noisy till late in the night. Monique brought us ear plugs which worked like a charm. If you are very sensitive to sound or need more than basic storage, then this apartment might not work for you. Other than that, the apartment and Monique are great!"
42970,6764528,2013-08-24,252526,Mary & Amanda,"My partner and I had a fantastic stay at Monique's B&B. Monique has thought of everything a guest might need in a well appointed flat.  You can surely see that she is running a business instead of just a casual Airbnb host as she was very responsive through out, very warm but also professional. She was also extremely accommodating as to our check in and check out time even though she had guests coming the same day of our check out. We really appreciated that!

The flat is very clean, has a SUPER comfy bed, and feels more like upscale, boutique hotel but in the best possible area of Amsterdam. We were so happy we stayed in this area because we were quite central, but away from the crowds while everything was easily walkable. 

We will gladly recommend Monique to all our friends and hope to return ourselves one day! :)"

It was also my first trip to Europe, which added to my excitement and anticipation.  Having heard great things about airbnb, we decided to gave it a (Website hidden by Airbnb) glad we did!!  After pouring thru dozens of options, I kept going back to, and finally settled on Monique's ""Best Location."" It seemed to be right on time; and, Monique sounded like such a lovely person and hostess.  So proud of myself for making the right decision....Monique and her staff were wonderful and accommodating; and the studio was nice and comfortable.  We LOVED Amsterdam, and Monique's ""Best Location,"" could not be beat!  What a lively and diverse street...everything within walking distance!! Those rather steep steps to our studio were a bit daunting at first; but, that was a small price to pay :o) All in all we were very pleased, and couldn't have asked for more...Thanks, Monique and thanks airbnb!!  Debby & Tony"
42970,7032896,2013-09-04,6159577,Anthony,"Monique was fantastic. Very helpful, vibrant and caring. Would not hesitate to recommend or stay here again. Amsterdam is an amazing place. Loved it."

The flat itself was very clean, really nicely decorated and comfortable. This was the first time I have ever used airbnb and I was really happy. Monique stopped by to say hello and she was really nice and helpful. I already told my friends to stay here when they travel to Amsterdam."

On arriving, we parked at the car at P&R and within 25 minutes we were at the doorstep. The place was clean and modern. Monique was very attentive and helpful. We will definitely return!"
42970,7390733,2013-09-18,6905599,Mary,"This is a great flat, centrally located in Spui and within easy walking distance to all the major sites. Read the other reviews -- the bed is dreamy, the bathroom roomy (for Amsterdam) and amazingly quiet given that the studio is right in the heart of the city's hustle bustle. We would rent here again!"
42970,7433125,2013-09-20,7266250,Benjamin,"This is the perfect apartment in the perfect location for everything in Amsterdam. Grab some Spanish or Indonesian food at one of the nearby downstairs cafes, or watch this eclectic city go by from the Cafe Luxembourg. An easy walk to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum, the flower market, the Red Light District, and Rembrandt Square. The television has English channels and the shower always has hot water. I really am a picky traveler and I could not find a better value in a better location. I plan on renting this place again next time I am in town!"
42970,7827026,2013-10-05,7713478,Steve,"Ideal location just outside the old area. We picked this as we had a car and there's plenty of parking. The view and the balcony breakfast area made this. Real treat as well as having two bedrooms in reality one of Monique's homes so it had everything like a home not an apartment. Seemed like all the best stuff just eft for us. Cosy cosy bed. So clean spacious and Monique just went that extra mile to help us with ordering our sight seeing and her suggestions books and maps excellent. Loved her meeting on arrival and departure. A great find within 10 mins walk to the old area. Thanks Monique we had a great look around thanks to you. Manjula and Steve, Bali Indonesia

42970,8037125,2013-10-14,4276769,David,Monique is a lovely personality.  She was very helpful in all the details.  Accomodation and location were superb.  Entrance stairs are a challenge if you are disabled.  We would stay there again if in Amsterdam.
42970,8192113,2013-10-20,117130,Scott,"First of all Monique is the best host I've stayed with on air bnb.  And if you've rented on here, you know that is saying something.

  She is very kind hearted and friendly, and makes sure that her flat has everything that you need.  Not only is her space in a perfect location, it's has a great feel to it and it is very comfortable and clean.  

You can stop looking for your holiday space now.  I highly recommend staying here!!

The apartment is very comfortable & is a ideal for exploring the city. Monique made us feel very welcome & we enjoyed chatting over an early NY eve drink before heading to Niewmarkt for an amazing evening, I have never seen so many fireworks! "

The location is fantastic, but also not too noisy right next to the street. The bed is so comfortable it's hard to get out of it in the morning. She also provided us with maps and books to borrow, which we found helpful. We hope to come back to Amsterdam soon. Thank you, Monique!"

Super clean and nicely designed - with a VERY comfy bed. It was very hard to have to leave. Had amazing sleep during the entire stay.

Location-wise, it is perfect as well and has a nice view of the houses opposite. You are close to everything - central or the beautiful canal area so it's very convenient. 

Monica was very kind and helpful, emailing me tips and recommendations before our stay. We couldn't have asked for more! "
42970,10200918,2014-02-05,3927682,Nadine & Sandro,Monique was a very nice and friendly host. Her apartment is a lovely and central place to stay.

Friendly host, she responded to every concern within half an hour and gift us with a bottle of wine at arrival.
Room was five minutes of walking distance from the Dam, the principal square of Amsterdam. We didn't even need to buy a bus-pass, we could move everywhere by foot. "
42970,10457199,2014-02-19,2976255,Jane,"Monique was a great host - quick to reply to messages and very welcoming. 
The studio was warm, comfortable and clean, with a large stack of city guides to use and a useful little kitchenette. The location was excellent with cafes/restaurants/supermarket nearby and with most sights walkable. There was some ambient street noise but that didn't bother me. Would definitely recommend!

42970,10556341,2014-02-24,12330948,Jasjeet,"A very pleasant place to live in. Literally in the city, it is walking distance from dam square and almost every main attraction. Monique is very welcoming and easy going. She is also very flexible  with timings and allows one to leave their bags at her place after checkout in an event of a late flight. Thank you for the wonderful experience Monique!:)"

Monique is a lovely host and tries everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We enjoyed our time and we would recommand the studio. As it has heating it is also recommendable in winter time. "
42970,10984454,2014-03-16,12119817,Galina,"Monique was really amazing. She met us late evening, made a cup of relaxing tea and help us to know everything about our appartments. Space is the same as in pictures, she added some shelfs above the bed and it was very useful. Also she provided small bed for our daughter and Irina liked it very much. She left some tea, coffee, cookes and wine in the kitchen area for us. 
Room is clean and full of sunlight. It is located in 17th century traditional house. Stairs are unusual, but it is quickly to get used to it. Bed is soft. Kitchen is fully equipped (we made some food for daughter, she don't like anything that we order in cafes except pomme fritte and apple juice). Also there are table and 2 soft comfortable chairs for breakfast. There are some travel books about Amsterdam near the mirror. On the 2nd floor there are washing and drying. It was REALLY useful when you travel with child.
Location is really the best! Especially for us. 5 minutes walk to Dam square, few tram stops to Museum Square and Central Station. There is Spui markets on weekends (Sat. - books, Sun. - paintings). Also there are a lot of book shops, antique shops and cafe's around it. I love this area and hope to visit Amsterdam again. 
I recomend Monique as a host. She has nice 2 appartments (I saw another one when I was waiting for washing machine to finish) and also she lives nearby so she could help you very quickly if something happened. It is important when you arrive late or leaving too early.

42970,11442665,2014-04-02,13589742,Kitty,Mooie studio in hartje Amsterdam. Vriendelijke ontvangst door Monique. Ze geeft je graag wat tips over de stad. De volgende dag kregen we nog een sms bericht of we het naar ons zin hadden en of ze ons nog ergens mee kon helpen. Top service!
42970,11492898,2014-04-05,10734078,Sam,"We loved our stay at Monique's place. The place was super clean and even smelled good. Monique was super friendly and easy to communicate with before our arrival. The one time we reached out to Monique during our stay about using the dryer, she responded within minutes and even switched our clothes over to the dryer for us. 

The location was great on a street with restaurants and bars, but it was never too loud at night. We were in the room just above the restaurant and you will hear them moving chairs or something around 11:30 or so when they close up, but I don't recall hearing any noise other than some birds in the window once in awhile. The bed was super comfortable with plenty of comfy pillows. It was definitely the best sleep I had on our entire trip away from home.  

It was easy to get around from her place and I would definitely recommend staying here for your Amsterdam adventures.

On arrival I was greeted by Monique who is very caring, making sure you have everything you need. I hope I can come back soon! "
42970,11751377,2014-04-14,5345711,Joana,"I stayed three nights with my boyfriend at Monique's studio. It was our first time in Amsterdam and we really enjoyed, partly because of the good experience with airbnb and Monique. She is really friendly and flexible and she gave us some good tips regarding restaurants. She left some useful maps and touristic guides in the studio. The studio is very clean, comfortable and well decorated. The bed is awesome. The location could not be better, we were pretty close of the everything. The only thing that scared me in the first time was the very steep stairs, but I forgot about it when I first saw the studio. Actually I think that these kind of stairs are typical in Amsterdam.
I'm sure that I will try to stay in Monique's studio in my next time in Amsterdam. And I will recommend it to all my friends. 
Thank you Monique!!!"

First of all, I and my wife would like to thank Monique for her warm welcome. It was our first time in Amsterdam and we had wonderful three days, partly because of the good experience with airbnb and Monique. She is really nice, friendly and helpful. She gave us some good tips regarding restaurants and you can find some useful maps and guides in the studio. 

Location is the best you can stay! It was very clean, comfortable and well equipped and was surrounded by plenty of places to eat and walk to. A few minutes walk to Dam Square, few tram stops to Museum Square and Central Station.

We'll definitely prefer Monique's studio for our stays in Amsterdam and recommend to all our friends.

42970,15462231,2014-07-09,2308131,Wendy,"I absolutely loved my stay in Amsterdam at Monique's lovely studio! I had the 2nd floor studio that overlooked the street. I loved opening the windows and hearing the buzz of the street. But a night when they were closed, I didn't hear much noise. The bed was super comfortable and the studio was super clean. I loved having a little kitchen for breakfast or for tea/coffee. Monique was accommodating and a great host when I came in early on an overnight flight. She is so warm & welcoming. I felt right at home for 3 days. And what a superb location. Doesn't get better. Also appreciated the map and suggestions on what to do and where to eat. I would only stay with Monique if I retuned to Amsterdam. Thanks Monique for a wonderful adventure in your beautiful city!  "

Unico neo le scale,ripidissime e strettissime,ma come confermatomi da un mio amico residente ad Amsterdam,sono quasi tutte così. 
Studios accogliente,MOLTO PULITO.
Un ringraziamento a Monique,che nonostante non ci fosse,é stata molto premurosa nei nostri riguardi,contattandomi più volte via mail per sapere se era tutto ok.
Ci ritorneró sicuramente"

She made sure that we were comfortable in the apartment, reviewed how to use appliances, gave us some suggestions/tips, and helped us find locations on a map. We saw Monique a few times during our stay and she was always friendly and welcoming. 

The apartment was great! My husband and I loved the great location and the room itself. Everything was visually appealing, easy to locate, and clean!! The bed was particularly comfy which we loved! 

The only thing to keep in mind is we visited in the summer and it happened to be abnormally hot. We had a fan, but other than that it was really uncomfortable some of the nights. Since it doesn't get that hot in Amsterdam there was no AC, but there weren't many AC units in all of Amsterdam so that was the norm and we survived. haha

Also, it can get a little noisy outside because of the surrounding restaurants, but we knew that and it wasn't too bad!

Overall, my husband and I loved Amsterdam and staying in Monique's apartment! We would love to come back and stay at her location in the future! : ) "
42970,16573710,2014-07-29,2905743,Sebastien,"The apartment is very well located at the heart of Amsterdam historical centre. A lot of insights are at a walking distance: canals, flower market, historical center, museum, 9 streets neighborhood, restaurants... For others, tramway is almost at the corner of the building (direct from Centraal Station)! 
The apartment is exactly as advertised, clean and cosy. We appreciated the small kitchen with the fridge and the Nespresso machine. The bed is also really comfortable. 
Due to its location, the apartment can be a bit loud at night. It can also be hot during summer. 
Monique is great host and was really available at every moment. She answered all my questions very quickly. 
Thank you!"
42970,16664804,2014-07-31,16818117,Adrienne," Monique is one of the best parts of staying in this place.  She is super fast at responding to your questions/needs and spent as much time as we wanted giving us advice on where to go/rent bikes/etc.   Our flight was delayed 2 hours and she waited to meet us at the front door.   The bed is the best we had in EU--for US customers, having a ""real king"" rather than 2 twins pushed together is super comfortable.   The noise is a challenge--the restaurants go until 2 AM, so you need to keep your windows closed.   There is a good fan which worked for us while we were there as the temp was in the low 70's at night.   

Don't take a cab--use her directions for train to tram.   The apartment is a 2 minute walk from where the tram drops you off.  

Monique also does the little ""extra's"" that make you feel super welcomed.  She left us a box of traditional Amsterdam cookies--its the small things that you appreciate when you are traveling"
42970,16898103,2014-08-04,2205127,Bruno,"If you're looking for a great place to stay in Amsterdam you've just found it! Besides being a unique and lovely host, Monique offers 2 apartments extremely well-located in the heart of the city. You have all major attractions in Amsterdam within walking distante, plus the Central Station (which is just 10 min away). Spuistraat, where it stays, has lots of bars and restaurants that work 'till after hours in the night and it's great to have a drink, dance, have a good time and just walk back a few meters to the apartment. Besides all this, the place is great, clean, well decorated and comfortable, making you feel at home. I definately recommend to anyone travelling the beautiful capital of Holland.  "
42970,17431654,2014-08-12,14350743,Dani,it was great !!

42970,19002768,2014-09-04,5132115,Richard,"We had an excellent stay at Monique's place. It's location within Amsterdam couldn't be beat, it was comfortable and light, and it's direct surroundings were full of energy which we could tap into immediately. Monique also put us in touch with a canal tour guide who gave us a tour of the city by boat tailored to our interests - what a treat! This place is a fantastic option in Amsterdam."
42970,19253359,2014-09-08,19325565,YunusEmre,Great place at the center of Amsterdam well equipped room satisfies all your needs.
42970,19511599,2014-09-14,15297036,Jenna,"Outre que le logement de Monique est bien situé, il est aussi très joli correspondant tout à fait aux photos avec un lit très confortable (matelas + surmatelas). Il a été facile de s'organiser avec Monique pour prendre les clés du logement et les laisser, elle est très réactive pour répondre aux mails et nous accommode du mieux qu'elle peut.  Je recommande cette hôte et ce logement."
42970,19876605,2014-09-20,17884547,Alina,"Ich war mit einer Freundin für knapp 4 Tage in Moniques Apartment und wir haben uns echt wohl gefühlt! Es war alles sauber, die Küche war klein, aber ausreichend und man hat gerne Zeit auf dem Zimmer verbracht, wenn man mal etwas erschöpft war! Monique selber war sehr gastfreundlich und herzlich und wir haben uns sehr über ihre Tips gefreut; die Bar, die sie uns empfohlen hat, war einfach Super! Die Lage der Wohnung war auch nicht zu übertreffen, man brauchte zu sämtlichen sehenswerten Orten kaum länger als 10min zu Fuß. 
Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen, wenn wir einmal wieder nach Amsterdam fahren! "
42970,20026137,2014-09-22,20229369,Kimberly,"This is a great place! Monique was traveling while I was there but she had a friend answering emails and taking care of everything while she was away. Overall, phenomenal location and great experience. Monique left a booklet with suggestions about what to do while I was in town. I went to 2 of the restaurants she recommended and and they were both great. "
42970,20162776,2014-09-24,20929417,Nicholas,Monique's apartment is incredible! It has everything you need ready and clean. The apartment is in a perfect and gorgeous location. The view is wonderful overlooking the neighborhood street. This is the best way to experience Amsterdam!

She was very cheerful as well. left us cakes because the tv didnt work. Someone may mind the noise from downstairs restaurants if leaves window open.  But we didnt mind too much.
Over all we had a good time."

42970,21567961,2014-10-19,14128413,Nopi,The apartment was great and exactly as described. Amazing location! I also loved the extra touch of the cable extension because there was no plug near the mirror :) Monique could not be there to greet us but had arranged everything perfectly and gave us lots of suggestions for places in Amsterdam. Would definitely return!!

We had a lovely view of the area from the window and Monique was great about giving us an overview of places to eat and things to see.   Also,  in a nice touch,   there were several guidebooks available right in the room for us to use.   Thought this stay was wonderful!"
42970,22039485,2014-10-28,10301909,Emily,We had a lovely stay at Monique's place. Thank you. It was a fantastic location to go off and explore the city from. 
42970,22196724,2014-11-01,16438791,Sarah,"Monique made us feel very welcome in her home- she made us feel like nothing was any trouble. The apt is beautiful and spacious and in the perfect location. It is ideal for walking everywhere and is in a neighbourhood with a great atmosphere. Stairs are very steep and quite small so perhaps not for those on the older side of life but would recommend to everyone else!
"
42970,22305849,2014-11-03,15828093,Keumjae,"She was waiting for me infront of the gate even i was there so early. 
She picked up the phone whenever i had a question and needed her. She was nice and kine. And also i could feel that she wanted me to have a great time in her house. "

The location is perfect "
42970,22988863,2014-11-19,23185518,Romina,"Monique welcomed us warmly upon our arrival with a cup of tea. She was very helpful and advised us a few places to go to. The studio was just as described or what you would expect from the pictures - clean, spacious and nicely decorated. It was well-located - right at the center of Amsterdam with everything at a walkable distance. If you are used to sleep with the window open, the neighborhood is quite nosy. Otherwise, the bed was super comfortable, we slept like babies! Thank you Monique."
42970,23227952,2014-11-25,1701862,Nisha Lilia,Monique's place is in a great neighbourhood- it's really pretty with lots of cafés & restaurants etc and walking distance from all the main sights. The studio is clean and comfortable and Monique was very friendly and welcoming. 
42970,23387453,2014-11-30,9364352,Benedikt,Monique was an amazing host. She gave us plenty of tips and helped to make our short weekend trip a great experience. Her lovely apartment is located in one of most beautiful parts of Amsterdam with very nice bars and cafés around as well as all major attractions in walking distance. We definetely wanna come back at some point.

42970,24242624,2014-12-23,14469669,Rachael,"After some initial problems with the room being ready on time and painters still working on/in the property when we arrived, we ended up having a lovely few days at Monique's studio - lovely clean room, good shower, coffee maker and fantastic location. Monique is also a very welcoming and laid back hostess who is always accessible if needed. Thanks for a great stay! "
42970,24489112,2014-12-29,17784263,Linh,"Monique's place was great!  It was nice and clean, and in a great part of town.  We were near shops and restaurants, and less touristy enough that you feel you're in a local neighborhood.  The place was exactly as described and although Monique couldn't be there the first day to greet us, she made sure she was available to say Hi and make sure we had everything we needed.  We really enjoyed staying at Monique's place on our first visit to Amsterdam and we'd recommend it to everyone!"
42970,24644085,2015-01-01,9369923,Elena,"Dear Monique Thank you for your amazing Apartment. it was wonderful, clean and in a good Location. We spent a lot of time in your Apartment....you are great. i hope i come back soon.

5 Stars on all accounts!"
42970,25702112,2015-01-23,12297212,Lucy,"Monique's Apartment is just the best one for visiting Amsterdam. The way from the airport is really easy to find it. The Apartment is very nice, clean, central and warm. Monique is a very nice person, friendly and very helpful.. I really enjoyed staying by Monique. Thanks for everything, Lucy "

42970,26695128,2015-02-17,26543997,Christopher,"I really enjoyed staying at Monique's bed and breakfast in Amsterdam.  I stayed in the second floor studio of her building, which has a restaurant on the street level, another rented studio on the third floor, and then her apartment on the fourth and fifth floors.  The studio is located in a wonderful part of Amsterdam, close to museums, restaurants and other sites.  I stayed alone but the studio easily has enough room for a couple and could be a very romantic getaway, if so desired.  Monique is a wonderful host, very accommodating and helpful during one's stay in Amsterdam.  She truly cares about your experience while there.  I would certainly stay at her place again."
42970,27177472,2015-02-27,27571893,Marie,"Super studio situé dans un quartier animé.  Le studio est bien équipé et très propre. Il correspond aux photos.  L'escalier pour y accéder est un peu raide mais comme il est situé au 1er etage pas de souci. Toutes les activités intéressantes sont situées à proximité accessibles à pied ou en tramway.  Il y a de nombreux restaurants très sympas à 2 pas. Monique est tres accueillante et très arrageante (notre train avait du retard, elle ne pouvait pas nous attendre mais s' est arrangée pour nous laisser les clés et un thé bien chaud nous attendait!). En résumé un très bonne expérience merci Monique! "
42970,27671450,2015-03-09,4862175,Lidia,"Location is perfect. The flat is small but it's enough space for a couple. Flat was recently renovated and it's furnished really well. 
Also Monique gave us a warm welcome and was ready to help.

As soon as for us it was a comfortable stay I want to aware next guests about perpendicular staircase in a building (room is on the second floor) and cold bathroom, while temperature in the room was OK. 
At the same time, Rituals... staff and a bottle of wine as a compliment easily helps you to save a positive mood :)"
42970,27856251,2015-03-13,2406672,Daniel,"Comfortable easy studio in a good location, thanks Monique. "
42970,27952729,2015-03-15,28398056,Jim,"One word to describe the experience - Amazing.

Great location (Just a minute or two from Spui) - You'll never wait more than a few minutes for a tram to/from Centraal Station.  

The flat has everything you could want for a weekend and Monique is so helpful and knows the area so well.

Many thanks.
I'll stay there again next time I visit Amsterdam."
42970,28195174,2015-03-19,18032641,James,"Comfortable and convenient.
Monique was the perfect introduction to Amsterdam. Thanks Monique "
42970,28729916,2015-03-29,6118272,Gillian,"We loved Monique's place. It is well situated, very comfortable, and has everything you could possibly need for a great stay in Amsterdam.
Monique made sure our arrival (and departure) went very smoothly, and made her presence known if we needed anything... Which we didn't, but she was nice enough to let us know she was there for us. The bed was a total dream (excuse the pun). The most comfortable I've ever slept in. Only good things to say. We will be back. Thank you so much Monique :-) 
"
42970,29621870,2015-04-10,4438096,Wendy,"Monique is awesome and the studio was lovely!  I had an absolutely wonderful 3 night stay with Monique.  She was such a great and timely communicator and made the perfect suggestion as to the best way to see the Spring Tulips at Keukenhof Gardens.  She had a lovely bottle of wine waiting for me at check-in and has her bnb stocked with helpful tourist info, maps, business cards of local restaurants etc.  The location was also PERFECT despite significant amounts of street noise in the mornings and late into the evening, but that is simply part of being in the heart of Amsterdam."
42970,29990897,2015-04-15,30118148,Stéphane,"Appartement idéalement situé, dans le centre de la ville et dans un quartier très agréable avec cafés, bars et commerces.

42970,30101174,2015-04-17,13422206,Warwick,"We had a great time staying at this apartment.  Everything was clean and ready to go on our arrival.  We stayed two nights and wished we could of stayed more... if only to be able to sleep more in the most comfortable bed ever! 

Our host Monique, was lovely and gave us some great local suggestions. 

Would defiantly stay again!"
42970,30442000,2015-04-22,1009343,Dave,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Monique's place in mid-April and had a wonderful time. We arrived earlier than the designated check-in time, but Monique was extremely accommodating and let us stay in her apartment instead of the one listed on Airbnb. She made us tea, showed us exactly where we should be eating/drinking/etc., and made us feel welcome. She even offered us her car for a day trip to Keukenhof, but we opted for the bus instead.

Monique's place is conveniently located in the Spui, which is a bustling place near the center part of town. Only a short walk to The Dam, Anne Frank Huis, museums, and the flower market. There were many great restaurants only a few steps from where we were staying, which was a huge bonus when we were tired after a long day of sightseeing. Overall, this was everything you could want in an Airbnb rental. I would most definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fantastic, clean, well-located place in the center of Amsterdam."
42970,31069219,2015-05-01,28850256,Michael,"The place is very nice and clean, just as described and shown in the pictures.

42970,31491289,2015-05-05,31346472,Patritsiia,"Thanks Monique for a clear approach to the business. Very detailed information about the city, how to get there. Pleasant Monique. The room is clean, cool bed, slept well. There are many pillows.Room is small, occupies the second floor of the house, like as a hotel room, bathroom too small. I think this is typical of the houses of Amsterdam. The room has a kitchen cabinets, kitchen utensils, place for washing dishes. Nice design. Everything was good. Like as a home hotel."
42970,32097317,2015-05-13,10113492,Brad,The apartment was amazing and Monique is a fantastic host. It's in the perfect location and it was just as Monique described it.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to other people visiting Amsterdam.

The stylish flat is bright, clean and in the very heart of Amsterdam. Very large bed is awaiting you which was super. Would always book again - thanks Monique!"

Location is perfect and room comfortable for two people.
Definitely recommend."
42970,33575081,2015-05-30,29403493,Allison,"Absolutely beautiful,
clean and well appointed apartment in a perfect location to explore Amsterdam. We were within walking distance of all the major sites and neighborhoods, and surrounded by great restaurants and cafes with tons to see and do! Monique was very helpful prior to our arrival, and even booked a taxi for us for our 5:30am departure. Thanks for a great stay Monique!"
42970,33796236,2015-06-01,30781305,Laura,"We had a great experience at Monique's B&B. The location was great and easy to get to restaurants, museums, shopping, etc. The studio was clean, well decorated and honestly larger than I expected. The bed was really comfortable and Monique left us drinks, wine and coffee. Monique was easily accessible and available for any questions we had during our stay.

One thing I would reiterate is that if you have trouble getting up and down stairs, you will have difficulty staying here. The stairs are very steep and when you add bags/suitcases, you will want to make sure you're comfortable getting up and down a tight and steep staircase.

I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this space!"
42970,34073724,2015-06-04,1846693,Stefan,My third time now with Monique and every time a delight!

Monique is nice and we got to meet her on the first day and the day we left. She has prepared everything we need in the room. Before we arrived, she responded to us quickly and it's easy to get to her place from the airport with her help. The location is good where every touristy spot is in walking distance. Will def choose to stay here again when we visit AMS in future."
42970,34635665,2015-06-10,10983671,Renza,"Monique was very welcoming and accommodating. The room is spacious with a comfortable bed & shower. In the centre of Amsterdam, close to Kalverstraat and restaurants, pubs. Perfect of you want to explore Amsterdam. Not suitable for elderly guests though due to very steep steps. We loved our stay with Monique "
42970,34760222,2015-06-11,5416321,Pace,Monique was great and super helpful for getting into the apartment and getting situated with the neighborhood. Fantastic location and very clean apartment.

42970,35437664,2015-06-18,28401650,Patrick,"Monique made us (my wife, 2 yr old daughter and myself) very welcomed and coordinated everything very quickly.  The area is perfect, great food (Tapas, Pizza, Indonesian, etc) right below.

She had everything laid out for us, including coffee and a guide around the area which was very helpful.

The apartment was perfect for us since it was centrally located - great location."
42970,35774397,2015-06-22,20752953,Nina,"Monique met us in the door as we arrived, and was availible the entire weekend for all of our questions. The studio is as described, and the location is perfect. My bestfriend and I had a fantastisk time, and will definetly be back!"

42970,36301004,2015-06-27,7242927,Carla,"Monique greeted us upon arrival and was very friendly and even had a bottle of wine as a welcoming gift. Her apartment is just as seen in the photo, only better. The room is very open and bright.  Monique anticipated every need a traveler would want and need. The location is wonderful. You can walk to all the tourist attractions and shopping and there's restaurants right outside your door.  But as Monique cautioned, the stairs are steep so keep that in mind if anyone has walking or balance issues. It's not a problem if you don't.
I've been to many Airbnb places throughout Europe and this one is truly my favorite.  I'd definitely recommend!"
42970,36665492,2015-06-30,30870250,Brenton,"Our experience in Amsterdam exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend Monique's place. Perfect location, definitely check out the 9 streets if you want food and more local shopping. Monique's apartment is perfectly located to suit everyone's needs in Amsterdam. And the bed, was so comfy!!"
42970,36903591,2015-07-02,23389793,Mary-Ann,"Didn't get the chance to meet Monique, given relative schedules, but had a lovely stay! The stairs are steep, as mentioned, but we were able to get our bags up and down without too much of a hassle. The place was very clean and looked just like it did in the pictures. Very easy to access most of the main attractions in Amsterdam, and the neighborhood was lovely. Thanks!"
42970,37326276,2015-07-06,21116607,Lulu,"Everything is beyond expectation in Amsterdam! Monique is the best host I have ever met, sincere, quick feedback, and prepared almost everything when we arrived. The apartment location, although many people mentioned already, is really prefect. This is a perfect experience and no doubt I will come back again to Amsterdam and Monique's studio."
42970,37693004,2015-07-09,23486573,Sandro,"Perfect . The location ia very nice .... Monique welcomed us very well and was very helpful..... "" super recomendo "" "
42970,37956574,2015-07-12,24805848,Tyler,Monique stays just upstairs and was there to greet us when we arrived. She showed us around the studio and gave us suggestions on where to go. Her website is very helpful in finding things to do and places to eat at. The apartment was on the second floor above a restaurant in one of the main squares of Amsterdam. This made the studio a great base for exploring the city. Monique made herself available throughout the stay and encouraged us to call her if anything went wrong. I would recommend this place if you want to be in the heart of the city and within walking distance of most major attractions. 
42970,38432361,2015-07-15,4533198,Chad,What an amazing place and an amazing host! Perfectly located...awesome bed and beautiful updated shower and bath! Just perfect for a 3 day visit to Amsterdam!
42970,38724052,2015-07-18,34510826,Kerry,The listing description was very accurate. Good central location but a bit load outside as there are several bars on the street. Very clean and perfect size for a few nights. 
42970,39413630,2015-07-23,6311398,Stephen,"Monique was most welcoming on our arrival, despite our being late by an hour due to a flight delay, and it was really convenient that she lives in the same building.  On our arrival, we were offered drinks and an introduction to the area from a local's perspective, and given some suggestions for things to do.  We had two sets of keys, so coming and going from the apartment is really easy - it's a perfect base for exploring the city in directions, and turned out to be ideally located.  Monique even organised a personal canal tour for us, which was terrific.  We would thoroughly recommend Monique's B&B to everyone."
42970,39768398,2015-07-26,6014969,Ginger,"This was our first AirBnB and it couldn't have been a better experience! Monique's charming studio is perfectly located on the  Spuistraat, conveniently located neat the tram station. From this location, we were able to walk nearly everywhere. One of our favorite restaurants was a few doors down. One night we had a storm that knocked out tram service. We didn't miss it at all. We were easily able to walk to restaurants and many bars. A++ location.  

The condo itself was immaculate. The bathroom is tiny but completely functional and includes a hairdryer. The best is comfy. 

Monique met us on our first night and gave some great instructions for dinner and other local restaurants.  She was completely accessible throughout our stay. 

I would go back in a second. We had a fantastic stay at an amazing place! 
"
42970,40934929,2015-08-03,30642167,Dave,"We had a great time at Monique's place in Amsterdam!  The appartment is very centrally located, and is easy walking distance to all the major things that you might want to see.  The appartment was clean, tastefully and comfortably furnished, and just the right size for two people.  Monique was a great host, and was always available for our questions or to help us.  When we (to our embarrassment) couldn't figure out the European door lock system, Monique was there to let us in.  When we needed a great canal tour to start our visit off, Monique was there to hook up a unique private boat tour that we really enjoyed.  When we needed extra toilet paper, Monique was there.  She was a great host and we recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Amsterdam!"
42970,41353617,2015-08-07,34559211,Rosalind,"Monique was very welcoming and had our room ready even though we were very early. She was very helpful about what to do and see and where to eat. The room was fantastic and great location. Stairs were steep but she helped us with our luggage. 
Thank you, we really enjoyed Amsterdam!"
42970,42461479,2015-08-13,26765078,Dave,"Monique is a lovely host. Upon arrival, she gave me the run down of the city and of everything I needed/would enjoy. Extremely friendly, helpful, and communicative. Her location is prime - seriously, it cannot be beat; pretty much everywhere is accessible by foot (25 minute walk tops) and very easily by bike (mere minutes). The bed was marvellous and wow, was the place kept in order. She even helped me with laundry one day. Highly, highly recommend. Thanks again."
42970,42878506,2015-08-16,178375,Hannah,"Communication with Monique was very easy. Her flat was perfectly located in walking distance to all the attractions we wanted to see. She also had a good list of places to visit, eat, and a discount at one of the bike rentals. The bed was VERY comfortable which is hard to find in AirBnB flats. There was also wine and drinks in the fridge when we arrived. 

We used the washing machine while we were there and the dryer (which didn't dry the clothes but Monique provided a drying rack). The internet was fast and reliable. The only strange thing was that the windows overlooked the restaurants on the street so people eating dinner could see into the flat if the curtains were open. Not an issue, just something to remember when getting out of the shower :)

We had a lovely stay and many people commented on how great the location was of the flat. "
42970,44162799,2015-08-24,37468283,Andreas,"Die Empfehlung, das Auto in der Tiefgarage am Olympiastadion abzustellen und öffentliche Verkehrsmittel zu nutzen, war goldrichtig. Die Schlüsselübergabe im Grillroom ""Taba"" klappte bestens. Das Studio liegt fast direkt am viel besuchten Spui. Man sollte daher gegen Lärm ein wenig resistent sein. Die Lage hat natürlich auch Vorteile: viele Restaurants und Kneipen in der Nähe, etliche Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß erreichbar."
42970,44477163,2015-08-26,38854320,Justine,"Un ami de Monique nous a accueilli puisqu'elle était en vacances. L'accueil était très bien. 
Le quartier est idéal : très bons commerces dans la rue. "
42970,44550064,2015-08-27,8202359,Faffa,"Monique's place is lovely! I was really happy that she warned about the steap steps because yes, they are quite intense! The appartment is in the perfect location and there is so much going on that we didn't even have time to do/try everything we wanted! :) Monique also provided us with A LOT of info (the best cafes, museums, bars etc). Highly recommended!"
42970,44899341,2015-08-30,30331920,Alexis,"My stay at Monique's place was great! I stayed with my friend for three days during the last weekend in August. The location was very central, literally walking distance to everything! We did not meet Monique as she was away on holidays but her friend Manuel (who was a great help) met us on our arrival day. The studio was very clean, spacious enough for two people. Although the apartment is above a busy street with  bars and restaurants, the walls are very sound proof! The stair case is very steep but other than that it was a 10/10"
42970,45442624,2015-09-02,10044274,Nigel,"I'd never used AirBnB before, my first experience was excellent thanks to Monique. The apartment is in a fantastic location for exploring the central city and is clean, tidy and well maintained. The memory foam mattress guarantees an amazing sleep and was super comfy! The hostess is absolutely lovely and I highly recommend saying hello and having a chat with her while you're there. There is a coffee shop a few doors down that shares a building with Hay, best coffee I've had in Europe in my few weeks here. I would happily stay here again!"
42970,46158247,2015-09-08,7068008,Rob,"The clear feature of the apartment is that it is extremely well- located. The "" designer "" coffee shop called Salon has fantastic coffee and deserts and located two doors down from Monique's apartment. We tried the tapas restaurant next door which looks touristy but was excellent. After taking trains and the tram to get everywhere in our prior location, Felipe and I loved the convenience of everything.

The apartment itself gives off a great vibe with plenty of light and a warm and airy feel with everything painted white. Bathroom is small but more than functional with plenty of hot water. 
Monique did a great job with our check-in and is very knowledgeable about the area.

We really loved this apartment."
42970,46699596,2015-09-13,12484421,Thomas,Monique was a great host. Her place is in great shape and is in a very good location. She also made checking in very easy. We will be back!
42970,47242265,2015-09-17,26512316,Kim,"Moniques apartment was in an excellent location, everything we needed was close by, restaurants, public transport,supermarkets and loads of shopping.
The apartment was exactly as pictured and the bed was very comfy!"
42970,48065396,2015-09-23,32646260,Jennifer,"This is our first Air Bnb experience and we are glad that we stayed at Monique B&B. Monique made the booking process easy and all the communication and checking in were smooth. The place itself is central to everything, walking distance to all the major tourist sites. There are plenty of eateries, restaurants, cafes and ""coffee shop"" around. The flat is spotlessly clean, neat with all the essentials that you would need. Monique was very welcoming and helpful, making us felt comfortable during our stay. We would highly recommending Monique B&B especially if you are a couple travelers...her place would be perfect. Note: the flat's stairs is very steep but it's not a big deal for us...I guess that's why Monique is looking so fit. Thanks Monique for a lovely stay. "
42970,48516124,2015-09-27,38596803,Austin,"Monique made us feel very welcome. She was there to greet us and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. The apartment was very clean and in probably the best location in Amsterdam. I would definitely recommend Monique's listing to anybody looking to visit the city. In addition, Monique provided recommendations for the best restaurants and various activities around Amsterdam. I would definitely stay there again. "
42970,48986196,2015-09-30,427069,Ken,"Monique is a fabulous host, and her apartment is lovely, well-situated in a nice part of Amsterdam. We found it to be perfect for whatever we were doing around the city, with a generous selection coffee shops, restaurants of all types, and shops including newsstands and bookshops — and quick access to all central parts of Amsterdam, from the Central Station to the Museum District, all just a short tram-ride away.

We cannot say enough good things about Monique. When we ran into an unexpected delay due to a missed flight, Monique was an angel. She rescued us by offering emergency accommodations and providing expert help in booking another flight. When my wife broke a bone in her foot before we arrived, Monique helped us immensely by re-arranging our accommodations so my wife would not have to climb many stairs. We are grateful beyond words for her many kindnesses.

The apartment had everything we needed: a deliciously comfortable bed with excellent reading lights, a gorgeous new wood floor, a nice bathroom with shower, kitchenette, and other amenities that made our stay comfortable from the moment we first stepped into our apartment. 

All of this, in a city of absolute charm and mystique, ready for exploration. We immediately regretted not having booked more than three nights there. Now, we are anxious to return to stay again at one of Monique’s lovely apartments! "
42970,50118080,2015-10-09,28999678,Jennifer,"We loved being in the center of the city. The apartment was very comfortable, clean - and Monique was so sweet to leave us water bottles and wine. She was very easy to get in touch with and quickly responded to emails. We also appreciated using the washer and dryer. "
42970,50444153,2015-10-12,5340601,Emily,"What a wonderful little apartment in a fabulous location! Clean, quiet (even though it's right on a major street). The famous Hoppe bar is across the street and Kantjl Indonesian restaurant is literally downstairs. Everything you want to see in Amsterdam is within an easy and lovely walk. 

Monique even makes her laundry accessible, which was a huge bonus for me. She is lovely and inviting and provided many tips for this first-time visitor. I will be back!"
42970,50848763,2015-10-15,41664091,Taj,Monique met us upon our arrival and was pleasant and accommodating. The place is exactly as described. The neighborhood is great- no issues and very safe to walk. 
42970,51132472,2015-10-18,8525893,Cheng,"We loved our stay at Monique's Airbnb. My BF and I stayed in one unit as our friends stayed in the other unit. Perfect for a group of 4! Amazing location with access to the GVB as well as taxis. Everything is within walking distance which was fantastic. Monique has everything readily accessible including wifi info, train, food options and things to do listed on her site. Felt that everyone in the surrounding neighborhood was really friendly and all spoke English. Very easy to navigate and safe. Would love to come back and stay here again! Loved our stay!! "
42970,51526031,2015-10-21,29759126,Jeremy,"Great flat, great host, great location! 

The flat was on the 2nd floor overlooking an active street, within walking distance of everything Amsterdam has to offer.  Nicely appointed, comfortable bed and furnishings and even an area to cook, if you prefer to stay in.  

Accessing the flat is easy, keyed entry to the foyer/stairs and keyed against into the apartment.  Be aware the staircase is very steep, felt like being on a boat.  Climbing wasn't an issue, but for some the entry might be a challenge.

Overall, a great stay! Monique was very friendly and helpful with everything.  We'd certainly return.

Thanks again,"
42970,52100962,2015-10-26,45149417,Callum,"Monique's apartment was perfect! Firstly the location is ideal. Outside of the 'touristy' area but close enough that everything you want can be reached in a small walk. Secondly the information provided by Monique, both before we arrive and when we were there, were really useful! Over all Monique was a brilliant hostess printing off boarding passes, etc.. 
Lastly the apartment was clean and as described (with addition to some snacks and drinks including some insane biscuits!) "
42970,52871746,2015-11-02,45919863,Vincent,"Monique is very welcoming. Everything was well organised. We received many tips on what to see in Amtersdam. The place is perfectly located, just a walking distance from the central station."
42970,53228568,2015-11-06,1775225,Cavit,"Monique is lovely and very helpful, even for last minute booking. The studio was impeccably clean and well kept. Only thing to bear in mind is that as of November'15 there is construction work immediately below the studio, which makes considerable noise during the day only. If you're out during the day anyway then it won't make a difference."
42970,53593081,2015-11-10,7266250,Benjamin,"Another great stay in Amsterdam at Monique's place. Best location, best price, best everything! Can't wait to return. "
42970,53900283,2015-11-14,47042687,Kalie,Excellent flat and time in Amsterdam! Monique was so accomodating and made us feel very welcome in her home. The flat was in a great part of town and within walking distance of all Amsterdam's major attractions. Very clean and has probably The most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! The street it's on is a bit noisy at night but nothing too disturbing. Overall would definitely recommend this flat!
42970,54225414,2015-11-16,41602498,Frederic,"Monique nous a reçu chaleureusement et nous a aidé pour trouver à nous garer en minimisant les frais. Il y avait à boire et de quoi grignoter dans le studio qui est très propre et très confortable. Il est situé dans le centre, il y a beaucoup de bars et restaurants autour mais l'isolation est parfaite.
Merci encore pour ses 2 jours très agréables."
42970,54419036,2015-11-19,39648590,Lauren,"No need to look further, this is the one!My stay at Monique's studio was amazing!

The apartment:
The studio is located very centrally in Amsterdam. Within close walking distance to all sites and the tram stops right out front for easy transfer from the train station and airport. Many great restaurants and shops also on the streets surrounding the apartment. The studio is one entire floor of Monique's beautiful building. Impeccably clean and decorated for maximum relaxation and convenience. The kitchen is fully stocked and the bed is crisply made and extremely comfortable. Towels are also provided. Washer/Dryer in the building (Monique will even show you how to use)! Monique was also thoughtful in leaving hand soap and lotion in the bathroom! Very quiet space at all times and very safe and secure.

The hostess:
Monique was a true pleasure to get to know and takes great pride in hosting visitors in her building. She offers great recommendations and tips for the city to help you make the most of your stay. Everything she suggested was spot on and made my visit very authentic. She is very attentive to details and does everything possible to make your visit a true vacation. Monique also lives in the building, so it's nice to know she's there to help if needed or just a friendly face to say hello to. 

Would absolutely stay in this studio on a return visit to Amsterdam. "
42970,54596070,2015-11-22,18962907,Cecile,"Das Zimmer ist wirklich sehr zentral und gut gelegen für eine Stadt-Kennenlern-Tour. Monique ist eine aufgeschlossene und freundliche Gastgeberin, die sich um ihre Gäste kümmert. Es hat alles einwandfrei geklappt, wir waren sehr zufrieden und kommen wieder.  "
42970,54958697,2015-11-25,46331161,Carmen,"Monique is an awesome host.  I felt like I was arriving at a friend's house.  Having booked the day of because of a cancelled trip to Brussels, Monique responded immediately and even offered us to leave our bags at her place while the place was being cleaned.

The location is perfect, just steps from the Tram, awesome restaurants (try the Indonesian place down the block), and the 9s shopping area.

The studio was clean, the heat worked well, and refrigerator and microwave was a nice touch."
42970,55700919,2015-12-04,8265526,Edgar,"Monique was an excellent host and went beyond all expectations with making us feel welcome.  The home is perfect, beautiful and near all sights in Amsterdam.  Also I really enjoyed the views from the apartment.  If you want to have the best experience in Amsterdam we highly recommend staying at Monique's home.  You won't be disappointed. "
42970,56419766,2015-12-13,46603991,Ruby,Monique is a fantastic host. Nothing was too much trouble for her. The apartment is in a perfect spot. Highly recommend both Monique and her apartment!
42970,56732592,2015-12-17,5824146,Rangel,"Great location - 5 to 20 minutes walking from museums, parks, shopping, train station, and most famous points of interest in Amsterdam. Great place - very clean and very well put together interior, everything was just as described and shown in the pictures.

Monique was an excellent host. She personally met and welcomed us to her place (even helped us with the luggage!) and gave us an overview of the area on the map. It was our first time in Amsterdam and we absolutely loved it! We'll definitely be back and would not hesitate to choose Monique's place again."
42970,56809295,2015-12-18,7229332,Sophie,"This is the perfect spot to stay in Amsterdam!! The location is central - we visited shopping, museums, and wonderful restaurants on foot... and the room is lovely. Cozy bed, great shower, city views, and little kitchenette... with homey touches to make you feel welcomed and relaxed. And Monique lives in the building - she is helpful and incredibly warm and welcoming. Enjoy!"
42970,57033870,2015-12-21,48413820,Ronnie,"Monique is unique! she was very hospitable and tried her best to make us feel at home as possible. The room  we got was pleasant and adequate for a couple. However... Monique has two rooms and we chose the lower room which was bigger and less steep steps to climb.
It turns out she can switch the rooms and so we got the upper room. So before you come make sure that you will get the room you asked for. All in all we had a wonderful vacation in a very nice room in a great location. In the center of Amsterdam in a very lovely street (spui straat which the dutch pronounce as ""spau""). We recommend this appartment and with warm regards to Monique who tried to make our stay as perfect as it can be. "
42970,57315756,2015-12-24,36277953,Hadrien,Très bon accueil malgré l'horaire matinale. Super quartier
42970,57886775,2015-12-30,10896636,Samantha,"Monique's apartment could not be any better situated in Amsterdam. You can walk to anywhere within 15-20 mins. There are ample good restaurants nearby and supermarkets are a few mins walk. The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in, and ample pillows meant no sore neck. The apartment has everything you need and Monique is very responsive to messages and questions. We will definitely stay in Monique's apartment next we are next in Amsterdam!"

This experience was one of the most spectacular experience in our lifes. We also had a great time ridding bicycle across the city, thanks to two super Monique's bicycles. Super Recommended!"
42970,65094817,2016-03-10,61359363,Fabian,"Nice and cozy apartment, that made our trip to Amsterdam so much more enjoyable. The way the apartment is located within Amsterdam couldn't be more perfect. Walking distance to every major sightseeing attraction, public transport and bars and cafes right outside the door. Monique was a lovely host. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and  had access to two bikes to get around town. 
This was our first time using AirBnB, but thanks to Monique and her Apartment it certainly won't be the last time. "

42970,68755267,2016-04-06,15497880,Sharlene,Monique was a great host! She was very responsive to all emails and questions and really made an effort to meet us on our arrival day to make sure everything was okay. The place is in a great location - we walked everywhere! The only thing we were surprised about were the steep stairs to get to the apartment but I think it's pretty common for homes in Amsterdam. Overall we had a great experience and would stay there again!

42970,73823298,2016-05-10,59583311,Jeff,"My wife and I stayed six days at Monique's apartment.  This was my first Airbnb experience, so given the location and price we wanted, we chose Monique's because of her Superhost status and over 200 good reviews.  It was an excellent choice.  Her business was very professionally run, much like a nice hotel, but the room and location were a much better value.  Monique kept in touch with increasing frequency as the travel date approached.  She welcomed us on the first day, answered our questions and then left us to explore the city.   There was a book that explained aspects of the accommodation and recommendations for sites and restaurants.  The apartment had a 2-burner electric stove top, Nespresso coffee pod machine, hot water kettle, and a refrigerator with a small freezer compartment.  Dishes, glasses and utensils were provided.  There were plenty of soaps, shampoo, conditioner and lotion.  Use of a clothes washer and dryer and extra towels were available.  There were tourist guidebooks, power adapters, a USB charger, wifi and television.  The bed was as comfortable as everyone has said.  The apartment was cleaned mid-stay, including new sheets and towels.  Monique checked on us during our six-day stay by email and she met with us at the end.  I felt comfortable that she would have responded quickly to any problems we had.  She provided a perfect balance of us feeling that we were cared for, while still being left alone.  So, quite the good experience for my first Airbnb attempt, and based on this stay I'll try it again.  I think I'll stick with Superhosts for awhile, hoping that they're up at Monique's standard."
42970,74706309,2016-05-16,20530823,Sandra,Super Appartement an bester Lage! Hat alles perfekt geklappt! Wir würden diese Unterkunft wieder buchen. Perfekt für ein City-Trip!
42970,76039691,2016-05-24,10472506,Thomas,"Very accurate.  She was there to meet us and as I said below was quite helpful.

Monica is a wonderful host.  Her place is in a great location.  Stairs are a little steep and when she saw our suitcases she just hoisted them up herself.  She was always available and helpful when we needed her.  The bed is very comfortable.  The 2nd floor (right above a very active street) was a little noisy but we had no problem sleeping when the windows were closed.  Would return in a heartbeat.

We were 1/2 block away from the tram that goes to Dam Square or the other way to the big museums if you do not want to walk.  Also just a few blocks away from amazing shopping.

Bathroom a little tight but not a problem.  Just not what Americans have at home.

Great experience."
42970,77066876,2016-05-30,45368026,Omar,"Monique was a great host - she's very friendly, helpful and responded to my emails in such a timely manner. The location of the Airbnb is amazing. It's located within walking distance of any locations or activities you'd be interested in. It's on a street with tons of restaurants and lively activity. To add to that, it's on top of a gelato place! :) I highly recommend this studio as long as you can handle small, steep stairs - Monique disclaims this in her listing and was honest about it."
42970,78559256,2016-06-07,48680820,Michael,"Monique was a fantastic host. Couldn't have enjoyed our stay more. She went out of her way to accommodate our needs, gave great suggestions on activities and restaurants/bars, and the location of her flat is perfect. Not too close to all the Red Light crazy, but easy walk to the Jordaan,  museums, and Centrum areas. 

Very Very happy with our stay. Thanks Monique!"
42970,79001794,2016-06-10,12306529,Waldemar,"The communication with Monique was perfect, she answered within minutes. She is a lovely, friendly person. Check in was also very smooth, the flat is just as described. You can't beat the location, a big supermarket 150m away, so many Cafes and Bars just outside the entrance door. Yes, the stairs inside are steep, avoid to lift up luggage with 40kg, hehe! All sightseeing spots are in walking distance. We really enjoyes our stay, thanks Monique..."
42970,80351366,2016-06-17,10560808,Sabrina,"We had a wonderful couple of days in Amsterdam and Monique's studio was certainly a highlight! We loved the studio, it was clean, so comfortable and smells delicious! Thanks for the hospitality and we hope we can come back soon. "
42970,81082879,2016-06-20,3292784,Peter,Monique was lovely and a great host. She stayed up for us even though we had a late arrival and was helpful throughout the stay. The location is perfect and very well-maintained!
42970,81757873,2016-06-24,1927783,Tamar,"We had a perfect stay at Monique place! Check-in was very easy, our room was ready even earlier than it was supposed to be. The place is just as described and shown in pictures! Very clean, great smell all the time, and the bed was the best one we had in ages!!! Like sleeping in a huge marshmallow :) The location is amazing, all the great places are minutes to walk to. Communication with Monique was easy, she replied immediately and was helpful. We highly recommend this place and we hope to come back for another stay!
"
42970,82499110,2016-06-27,6711427,Katie,"Monique was a wonderful host. She made sure she knew what time we got in so that everything could be prepared, and left us with a lot of recommendations for what to do. The apartment is absolutely pefect - the location is right on a popular street, with loads of cafes and bars around. Everything was clean and the bed wa super cozy! This was definitely one of the best airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Would highly recommend! "
42970,82665553,2016-06-28,60829618,Jenna,"This is the perfect place in Amsterdam. The bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom comes equipped with great shower products. It is very close to practically everything in Amsterdam so no need to Uber or train anywhere. The only problem we encountered was with the washer and dryer, which is no fault of Moniques. Apparently the washer and dryer in Europe do not function the same as the ones in the US, and we've since learned our lesson to only do laundry at home. Minus the adventure with the laundry machines, we will happily return. "
42970,83147999,2016-07-01,52165666,Jennifer,"Great location!!! Monique was a wonderful host, with a great apartment in the middle of Amsterdam! She was very welcoming, and met us to let us in even when we were late due to flight changes.  This place was exactly as expected in the middle of restaurants and very walkable to sights Amsterdam had to offer! Would definitely stay here again when visiting Amsterdam!!! "
42970,84977216,2016-07-10,66610035,Katy,"The apartment was perfect and exactly as described in the listing. Monique was super nice and responsive to all our questions. Would definitely recommend and come back in the future! 
"
42970,85660820,2016-07-12,59755200,Calle,"Monique was an amazing host! This was my first air bnb and she set the bar high! The room was so clean and welcoming - far more comfort than a normal hotel. I loved the personal touches like the bottle of wine, nice soaps and robes. The bed was also SO comfortable.

The location was great. It was easy to get to any part of the city as it was centrally located. It took us no more than 20 minutes to get to any destination. "
42970,86246801,2016-07-15,5046274,Susana,"Great location! The apartment is perfect for two, Monique was very helpful and nice. She had good recommendations and tips. We enjoy very match!
Thanks for all Monique! "
42970,88210437,2016-07-23,56398942,Asher,We had a great time in Amsterdam! Bikes were an awesome addition!
42970,90319879,2016-07-31,42507956,Erin,"Monique's room was lovely and she could not have been a better host. The location of the space is convenient to walk or bike anywhere in Amsterdam. Thank you, Monique!"
42970,91455387,2016-08-05,47924402,Cindy,"Monique's studio apartment is all that is promised and more! It is even more spacious than it appears in the photos and is quite well appointed....loved the orchids! The stairs up to the apartment are as steep as described by Monique and others, but we found them to be part of the charm of the place. The location is spectacular with restaurants, pubs, and cheese market across the street and the gelato store  just below. It was fun to open the windows and hear the sounds of the street. But with the windows closed, the apartment is surprisingly quiet, which, with the wonderfully comfy bed, made for great sleeping. The tram is just around the corner, which makes the entire city quite accessible. And the two bikes are a real bonus—don't be intimidated to join the other cyclists pedaling along the canals! Monique was easy to communicate with and responsive to all our questions. This flat is perfect for a visit to Amsterdam!"
42970,92622207,2016-08-09,43806778,Yigit,The location is amazing and Monique is lovely.
42970,93533421,2016-08-13,24841056,Justin,"Monique was on holiday when we arrived, but she made sure to keep in constant contact with us and made herself available to answer any questions we had. The flag was great, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the location was amazing!"
42970,94408731,2016-08-15,31232575,Katie & Alberto,"This studio was so perfect! The bed is very comfortable so be careful not too sleep in too much. The location is great and there is a really great tapas downstairs. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Monique in person,but she was very prompt to answer through call/txt. Everything was clean and instructions and tips were left in the room for us. We will defiantly be coming back!"
42970,97130198,2016-08-26,5105315,Joe,"Very charming studio in the heart of Amsterdam. Very centrally located. In the height of summer it can get a little hot and the laundry isn't in the flat itself, but rather I'm a shared closet. Monique is very hospitable."
42970,99898752,2016-09-06,11683630,Melih,Amazing experience to be in that apartment. Monique was wonderful to us and helped us in every question. The apartment is in the middle of everything and that is really great! 
42970,103577017,2016-09-23,17508985,Eric,"Great host. We arrived after some serious jet lag, and Monique ensured we had a smooth transition into wonderful Amsterdam. Location is absolutely superb. Right in the middle of everything. Will gladly stay here again when we return to Amsterdam."
42970,105855489,2016-10-03,29534141,Michael,"Fantastic hospitality and great place to stay. The location is close to all major tourist sites, and having the bike available makes everything less than a 20 minute bike ride. The host was kind enough to help me with printing out an e-ticket for me, which could have been very difficult to do otherwise. The bed is very comfortable and everything was clean. Also the small touches in having snacks and drinks available was great. Only downside is that the location is across the street from a few cafes and bars, so could be a little noisy despite the sturdy sound-proof windows. Will definitely visit again. "
42970,106099235,2016-10-04,17366572,Matt,Awesome place in the center of Amsterdam!
42970,106817668,2016-10-08,43224910,Ryan,"Loved my stay at Monique's place. I searched quite a few places on Airbnb before deciding and was very happy with my choice.  It is located in a very posh area. A lot of the recommended restaurants I wanted to try were in walking distance. Great brunch spot I liked was Greenwood. Very fresh and tasty. A few minutes to redlight district, Dam square and 10-15 walk to Anne Frank and Van Gogh museum. And very close to a bunch of shopping locales. We walked everywhere we went. Place is located in the middle of a popular nightlife street.  You can hear from the room but with windows closed it was at a  minimum.  I read about the stairs being steep. Very true statement. It was closer to a ladder. But didn't bother me. 

The bed was very comfortable and the shower had good water pressure. A plus when away from home. :)

Overall I would stay here again. "
42970,107602627,2016-10-11,16893479,Bala,"Perfect location, great hospitality, and excellent communication. Would recommend anytime."
42970,110117441,2016-10-24,2379730,Matt,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Monique's apartment.  The location is fantastic as you can easily walk to all the great areas of Amsterdam.  If you would rather take the tram, then most lines are right around the corner.  Many great restaurants and pubs are literally right outside the apartment.  Lastly, I'd like to mention that the bed is very comfortable, one of the best we've experienced on our trip!"
42970,111070858,2016-10-30,30637762,Hanan,"Great experience in Amsterdam.
Apartment location was absolutely perfect... in the center of Amsterdam's scene... (nevertheless, inside the apartment it was very quite).
Monique was a great host and available to everything we needed, including recommendations which we followed.
Bottom line - Great experience...
"
42970,112971625,2016-11-09,14093492,Travis,"Monique's place is in a perfect location and is central to everything. It is just one room but very cozy and perfect for a single or couple. The bikes are a nice touch as well, but they are made for tall people. Probably have to rent a different one if someone is shorter than 5'5"". I really enjoyed my stay here and would visit again! "
42970,113537590,2016-11-13,93817218,Vanessa,"Monique a été présente dès le début et le dialogue a été simple, facile et convivial.
L'appartement est génial. Le lit est immense et très confortable, la pièce est très cosy et agréablement décorée, il y a tout l'équipement nécessaire à un séjour parfait. Nous avons beaucoup aimé les petites touches supplémentaires et les cadeaux de bienvenue qui apportent un petit plus, comme la bouteille de vin sur la table ou le frigo garni de bouteilles d'eau, jus de fruit et bières !
L'appartement est extrêmement bien placé, dans une rue vivante et proche de tout. Effectivement il ne faut pas être sensible au bruit car le quartier est animé, mais pour notre part, c'est ce qui nous a plu. L'escalier de meunier est aussi effectivement très raide, mais c'est un escalier typique et ça fait partie du charme. 
Il faut absolument aller diner dans le petit resto indonésien juste en bas, un délice !
Bref nous avons adoré notre séjour dans l'appartement de Monique et nous le recommandons à 100 % !"
42970,115643492,2016-11-26,11180938,Carmen,"Just perfect!! The apartment was beautiful, clean, big (more than the photos) and whit a lot of light and beautiful views of the street, and the location simply perfect, whit a lot of restaurants, pubs and cafes in the same street and very close to Dam Place and others places in the city, so you can go walking everywhere. 
The only thing you must know is that the stair are very steep!! But is was no problem for us.
Definitely I recommend this place, and if I come back I would like to repeat :)"
42970,116307206,2016-11-29,7876596,Lynsey,"Great place! The bed is sooooo comfy. Great tapas place right next door. Monique was in communication immediately after booking. She even offered great tips on where to go. The lighting is a little low, especially in the bathroom. And there are no outlets in the bathrooms so some women may find that an inconvenience. Wifi worked great.  Very steep staircase going up to the apartments. Practically a ladder. Enjoyed our stay very much. Monique was a great host. She wasn't there to check us in but the lady she put in charge was very friendly and helpful. Thanks Monique!"
42970,117183491,2016-12-05,75619367,Georgia,"Monique's apartment is modern and cosy, it is very well located, a five minute walk from the main square and no more than 15 minutes to get to all of the main attractions. Monique left us some wine, snacks and drinks at the apartment which was really lovely when we arrived hungry and thirsty for wine!! The bed was one of the most comfy beds I have ever slept on, I did not want to leave it! If you are a lightsleeper I would advise bringing earplugs as the apartment is on a busy road and there is apartments above so can be quite noisy at night and early in the morning. Also be advised that there is a code for the front door, as me and my partners keys for the front door would not work and we had a slight panic!! Would definitely return to this apartment "
42970,120242063,2016-12-09,4051615,Yannine,"Monique's place it is exactly as the pictures show it. Very modern and good-sized for a solo traveller or a couple. It has all the amenities needed for a pleasant stay, even a guide with explanations about the use of the drier and washing machine and suggestions of restaurants and places to go. Communication with her was very quick and clear, always very responsive. Overall i had a great stay, and would definitely recommend Monique's place as it is well located and she made me feel at home :)"
42970,121215280,2016-12-15,55649425,Nima,Moniques apartment was perfect. Apartment was in an ideal location within walking distance of everywhere; but the added bonus of having bikes made it even easier! Definitely recommend biking around as it's as authentic to Amsterdam as it gets! The stairs to the apartment are steep but the bed is worth climbing a mountain for ( so comfy) . She left us out some wine and snacks which was really nice to arrive to! Definitely reccomend this apartment and we will be back very soon! 
42970,121629385,2016-12-18,17048181,Monica,"Aunque no conocimos a Monique personalmente, ha habido buena comunicación. Su amiga Astrid se encargó de explicarnos el funcionamiento y permitirnos dejar las maletas en otro sitio antes de la hora de nuestra entrada y después de la salida. Todo un gusto! Las escaleras de acceso son estrechas y muy, pero muy verticales, unos 80 grados casi nos atreviríamos a decir! y no cabe el pie en ellas, así que mejor ir poco cargados. Al final le coges la práctica al subir y bajar. Toda la ciudad es igual, así que no es para alertarse :).
El piso es muy acojedor, idéntico a las fotos y ubicado en el centro de la ciudad. Durante cuatro días no usamos ningún transporte para desplazarnos y visitarlo todo. Al no conocer la ciudad no nos atrevimos a usar las bicicletas. En el piso hay también un montón de guías turísticas y información, muy útil si no se ha planeado antes qué hacer.
El barrio es un poco animado, varios bares por la zona, pero por suerte cierran a la 1 de la madrugada. Es solo ruido de gente hablando y no de tránsito, ya que todo el mundo va en bicicleta, pero mejor llevar tapones si os cuesta dormir. También se escuchan un poco los del piso de arriba, y el subir/bajar la gente por las escaleras. 
Si volvemos a Amsterdam algun día, muy probablemente repetiremos!"
42970,122411761,2016-12-23,107519355,Alex,"Nice location, clean and would recommend to friends and family."
42970,125543963,2017-01-06,48195489,Grace,"Beautiful studio in the center of the city.  Could not have been in a better location! Within a ten minute walk of the Anne Frank House, Tulip Museum, the Jewish Museum, and about a block away from the Amsterdam History Museum.  Loved my stay! 

Note: stairs to get up to studio are incredibly steep. "

42970,134144489,2017-02-26,20246415,Shaun,"The appartment is exactly as described.  You are a short stroll from the beating heart of Amsterdam.  Make sure to try the restaurant ""Haesje Claes"" it's about 50 meters from the front door, they serve amazing traditional Dutch food.  All in all a great little apartment for a stay in Amsterdam.  

An added note.  Your host Dionne is a marvel, we had 2 large cases from a month of travel she carried them up the stairs like a pack horse.  

Thanks so much for the help Dionne."
42970,136200945,2017-03-09,34225502,Scott,"This review is from my daughters, who stayed at Monique & Dionne's place:

Really great studio apartment steps from the De 9 Straatjes neighborhood. It was within a twenty minute walk of all the touristy spots, and had some great local spots nearby as well. Dionne was an incredible host (she let us keep our luggage in the building before check-in and also called a cab for us the morning we left). We hope to be back!"
42970,136711932,2017-03-12,53598422,Chris,The apartment was in an ideal location for us - very central and everywhere we wanted to go to was within walking distance. Lots of nice places to eat nearby and walking distance from the train station which was handy. We were greeted personally even though we arrived late at 10pm and communication/advice from Dionne was great

42970,143804710,2017-04-13,29058536,Andreas,"Very nice and comfortable apartment in the city center of Amsterdam! But remember to park your car (if you have one) in a parging garage somewhere nearby. Perfect location to start exploring the city. Steep stairs should be considered before booking. Check-In and -Out was quick, easy and flexible (thanks Diana!). :-) I´d recommended the location !!!"
42970,145620947,2017-04-19,9714722,Nicholas,"From check in to check out Dionne's accommodation was perfect and her hosting skills was unparrelled. She greeted me with open arms and had everything a guest would need. From water to snacks, lovely bathroom soaps to Amsterdam guidebooks. The apartment was perfectly clean and in an incredible location. I was warned about noise but I honestly don't have any complaints, it was peaceful and quiet for my entire stay. I would recommend her place to anyone who is traveling to Amsterdam for their first time. She was very respectful and very kind, I had her number and was always responsive if I needed. Five star Airbnb experience. Thank you!"

The location of the apartment is probably one of the best in Amsterdam, you got everything you may need just around the corner. The room was very clean and the bed is great. Clean smal bathroom with good pressure in the shower. I would definitely recommend this airbnb to everyone. Thanks for everything Dionne!"

They even left us snacks and a bottle of wine.  It rained and there were umbrellas for us to use right by the front door.  The designer amenities in the shower were amazing! This place is located in the PERFECT LOCATION.  The bikes added to our experience in this beautiful city.  We were able to use the washing machine and dryer which was an added bonus.  Many restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions are located walking distance.  We will definitely be back in the future!!  We loved the hosts and the place we stayed! Thank you very much!!"

Good comunication, great place and friendly people."
42970,187505679,2017-08-27,111253503,João,"My stay at Dionne's was great. She was great to communicate with and everything agreed upon was fulfilled on her behalf. She was very available, but could still give me all the privacy I requested. The room itself was clean, organized and pretty darn quiet when you consider you're at the city center. Great mattress, small but fully functional restroom, night lighting was good, good Wi-Fi and fridge (with freezer), decent cable tv, and 94% efficient blackouts (very rare in Amsterdam). Several complimentary drinks and snacks upon arrival, two bikes and good vibe to the building and the area. There are some mosquitos in the summer and I have a problem with that: Dionne got me a great (and quite beautiful actually) mosquito net for the bed.
Great stay! Close to everything on foot and at the same time, very comfortable and peaceful. Thanks Dionne!"
42970,188420372,2017-08-29,21728174,Julia,Monique and Dionne were wonderfully accommodating hosts. Their attention to the small details and making it a point to get to know us made our short stay in Amsterdam a true pleasure! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
42970,189554241,2017-09-02,31367786,Jaffet,"Amazing place , the bed was very comfortable, location was great and Dionne was very good at communicating throughout our stay . The Sonos speaker was awesome 10/10 would recommend !"
42970,193060325,2017-09-12,16849938,Zbigniew,"This is a great place - a wonderful central location and a homely, comfortable feeling! Our host Dionne was very kind and gave us lots of tips, all of which were fantastic.  We would definitely stay here again, as it really added to our vibrant Amsterdam experience!"
42970,196403341,2017-09-23,72494667,Kristin,"First, the location was phenomenal! The neighborhood is in walking distance from everything, including tourist attractions, great food, and good shopping. The apartment was very clean. Our host changed our sheets in the middle of our week and made sure we had fresh towels. She was very attentive and answered any questions we had. Be sure to visit the cheese shop across the street too! We would definitely return to this Air bnb. I love Amsterdam!"
42970,198430395,2017-09-29,21146467,Randy,Space was very clean and was offered everything we needed for our short stay! Monique was wonderful and very friendly. We would definitely stay here again when we come back to explore this beautiful city!
42970,199940476,2017-10-03,151125109,Sarah,Perfect place for a wonderful trip!
42970,202156850,2017-10-10,47721592,Leanne,"We arrived early from a boat tour and Dionne warmly welcomed us, helped us lug our bags up the steep steps and kept them for us until the previous guests had checked out. We arrived home to find our bags delivered to our rooms and everything ready. Having the use of the washing machine and dryer was fantastic. For many people this is not a big deal but we had been travelling for two weeks by this time and it was wonderful. Dionne even helped us with this. The bikes were great but I'm rather short so it was a bit tricky to use easily. My husband had no problem. Thanks for your hospitality Dionne."
42970,202829981,2017-10-13,9453637,Logan,"There aren't enough good things to say about the place or the service. You can't beat the location--it's right in the middle of the city, near the canals and lots of cute shops and good restaurants. It's close to everything and you can literally walk or ride a bike everywhere within 15 min. or less. We only used the trams to & from the airport. The apartment was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Dionne made everything very personable and made us feel very welcome. We hope to come back and stay again!"
42970,204291419,2017-10-17,14628037,Yurissa,"Excellent place!!! Location more than perfect right in the center, bed and bathroom amenities awesome, and lovely treats! Thank you Dione! We had an amazing time!"

42970,220406093,2017-12-22,98204432,Amy,"i stayed here with my niece as we explored europe and we thoroughly enjoyed amsterdam. this apt is in a great location in central/downtown. you can walk there from the train station and enjoy the quiet biking life of amsterdam with the 2 bikes that are included. excellent bed and bedding. bathroom and shower were nice. the only hard part is the steep stairway to get up into your second floor room, but for young active people it is do-able and likely the norm of apartment living in amsterdam! thanks for the great stay."
42970,223480297,2018-01-01,95286082,Christy,A great place to stay in Amsterdam! In the heart of the center and close to great restaurants and within reasonable walking distance to the sites or close by for public transport. Dionne is very hospitable! We stayed during a holiday weekend (New Years) and we could message/call and she was quick to respond. The place was very clean and we felt very safe. Great place you need to book!!!
42970,226180370,2018-01-09,6328053,Stefanie,"My friend and I stayed our first night in Amsterdam in a hotel and the next two nights in Monique and Dionne's Airbnb. WOW, what a contrast. Dionne (we didn't get to meet Monique) was the perfect reminder of why I love staying at Airbnbs. 

Dionne was such a gracious host (she made us chocolate pie!), and we had a fun conversation about traveling, America, and life in Amsterdam. The amenities were great (she left us a bunch of complimentary drinks and snacks), and the location perfect. Wish we could have stayed for longer. Thanks for the lovely stay, Dionne and Monique!"
42970,227555399,2018-01-15,157404508,Nicole,"We had a great stay in amsterdam.
It‘s at the perfect soot to go everywhere in amsterdam."

42970,233121247,2018-02-08,154119331,Zamara,"Amazing stay. The location is more than perfect. Everything is walking distance, tons of coffeeshops, restaurants and bars on the same street. Definitely staying here again when I return to Amsterdam"
42970,234557549,2018-02-13,169903052,Christina,"Sehr freundliche und warmherzige Betreuung, sehr sauberes Appartement mit toller Lage! 
Wir würden wieder dieses B&B buchen.
Nur man muss fit bei der Treppe sein! Altbau Amsterdam, wird aber auch erwähnt. Ein Erlebnis "
42970,236422123,2018-02-19,28964521,Elaine,"I love this little white apartment, center, clean and stylish. Dionne is super nice, helped us a lot, always reply immediately. Many thanks! Recommend her place to everyone!!"
42970,239127610,2018-02-28,155649083,Bridget,"Everything about this place is wonderful. The location is perfectly and centrally located near great restaurants, shopping, and transit stations. Dionne was our main point of contact and she made sure we had everything we needed from check in to check out. Our group was 2 people and we stayed 4 nights in the room on the 2nd floor. The room fit both of us (and both our over-packed suitcases) very comfortably. The room and bathroom were very clean and had ample towels/ amenities. We stayed mid-winter and were plenty warm. The stairs are extremely steep, as advertised. All in all, we couldn't imagine a better place to call ""home"" other than Dionne & Monique's charming studio in Amsterdam."
42970,239304968,2018-03-01,80890610,Angelica,"Dionne and Monique B&B was way better than expected. Dionne was an awesome host and very helpful and super sweet and kind. We loved the very spacious room, the bed was very comfy, she even left treats and drinks for us. Way better than a hotel room. Definitely stay there next time I’m in Amsterdam. Thank you Dionne for being amazing."
42970,245407822,2018-03-22,70113439,Sofia,"Monique & Dionne’s place was amazing. It has the perfect location, perhaps the most important factor for me when choosing where to stay. The decor was beautiful, Monique was lovely and the amenities were more than I’d expected! A hairdryer with diffuser, snacks and tea, robes, even two Heineken’s! I couldn’t have been more pleased with this place. If you haven’t yet made your mind up on where to stay, well, this is the place."
42970,251484304,2018-04-08,27219777,Charlotte,"Monique & Dionne’s place was perfect for our weekend stay in Amsterdam. We were able to walk everywhere easily from the room. It was a large space with everything we needed. We received lots of useful recommendations and tips from Monique and Vicky. We were able to leave our things there as we arrived early. It was a little expensive but everywhere in Amsterdam is and this was definitely the best place to stay. Thanks for the lovely stay, we had an amazing time :)!!"
42970,267594476,2018-05-22,94988405,Stephanie,"Monique's apartment is very clean, beautiful and well-run. Nice amenities are provided which made our arrival, after long travels, much more comfortable. 

We highly recommend this apartment. Thank you"
42970,279348286,2018-06-20,178258732,Eean,"If you have the opportunity to stay here I highly recommend it. What a wonderful location run by amazing people, oh and you have to check out the Tapas place two stores down on your left."
42970,286042903,2018-07-05,189328157,Paige,"Although we only stayed a couple of nights, it really felt homely! The space was light & clean, bed was to die for  Vicky was really friendly & helpful. Can be a bit noisy outside but can barely hear it with the windows shut. Also nothing will prepare you for just how steep the stairs are  Really miss amsterdam & wish we could've stayed longer! Also the collection of cards for various local businesses was a really nice touch"
42970,288094839,2018-07-09,13713365,Janet,"As other reviewers have stated, this place is amazing. Right in the middle of everything in Amsterdam. The added bonus for us was the bikes, we rode everywhere!  

Clean and great hospitality.  Will definitely stay again when we come back!"
42970,289474173,2018-07-12,37045424,Kristjan,Amazing flat in the center of Amsterdam. Easy walks to the major sites and lots of great bars and restaurants. Monique and Vicky were really responsive and reached out early to make sure our stay was perfect. Look forward to staying here again next time we’re in Amsterdam!
42970,292217265,2018-07-17,87305051,Alex,Great host and great bed and breakfast!
42970,296638804,2018-07-26,12586640,Angela,"Great location. It is walking distance to a lot of good restaurants, cafes & museums. If you do not like to walk, it is 3 minutes away from a tram station! Our stay here was great :)"
42970,303288736,2018-08-07,5491867,Sue,"This is a fabulous place to stay. There were so many thoughtful touches. Wine, beer, water, snacks, shampoo, robes, hair dryer, coffee, a fan to help cool off from the heatwave. Lots of tips and guides to Amsterdam. Check in was smooth, communication was excellent and prompt. The bed was the most comfortable of our month away! Location was great with lively cafes and shopping, but not too touristy. Close to everything. It was also sparkling clean. Would not hesitate to stay here again!!!"
42970,304757620,2018-08-10,191533684,Ellie,"Thank you so much for having us! Vicky was very accommodating, I knew if there was anything I needed she was just a text away, however the space was very private and there were no disruptions which was something I really appreciated. The room is lovely, I couldn’t get over how perfect it was for me and my boyfriend. It’s in the perfect location, on a lovely street only a pleasant little walk away from the busier areas. The bed is the biggest and comfiest I’ve ever been on! And the windows looking out onto the street are amazing, they open right up so you can look out onto the street properly. The mirrors are beautiful, all of the interior is really simple but rustic in a way and everything was so clean. The refreshments left in the fridge and wardrobe on arrival were a really lovely touch, as well as the hair dryer and plug converter! I can’t imagine a better apartment we could have stayed in, it made our stay in Amsterdam everything we wanted it to be and more because it made us feel like we got to experience living there. Thank you so much! Xx"
42970,308327944,2018-08-16,61577872,Jesse,"This apartment was super cute, clean and VERY central! It was really fun opening the big windows and sitting above Spuistraat and people watching from the room after a long day of walking around. Monique sent us several restaurant recommendations that we ended up going to (and loved), and was great getting us connected with Vicky, who checked us in, showed us the room and bikes, and even helped order us a taxi to the airport when we left. The room had everything we needed - a coffee maker, a bottle of wine, cups, glasses & plates, a big beautiful bed, a big closet and a mini fridge. We are happy we stayed there for our trip! "
42970,310261697,2018-08-19,51411549,Will,Great location on the tram line. The immediate neighbourhood is loud and vibrant with great food and entertainment. We enjoyed going over to Cafe Hoppe on or last night for drinks. Easy access to get around the city.  
42970,312299831,2018-08-23,79960814,Kulvinder,"The best place to stay in Amsterdam. Everything is just right... The place..The hospitality..The location ...The thoughtfulness of the hosts Monique and Vicky. 

Go for it. You cant go wrong here...

"
42970,314619903,2018-08-27,19197440,Joshua,Room was clean and as expected. Hard to find a better location. Convenient and close to everything!
42970,316023261,2018-08-30,22030772,Luis Carlos,"Hands down the perfect place to stay if you're traveling alone or as a couple. After making a few rounds throughout the city, I found that although there really is no bad place to stay in Amsterdam, the location of Monique's place is conveniently amazing. I felt like a local! Walking score is 10/10. Her place has everything you could possibly want. Bed was awesome. The shower was spacious and had amazing water pressure. And, her place had everything you could possibly need to settle in comfortably. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Just in this case, you get a little extra ;) Highly recommend."
42970,317487868,2018-09-02,170451680,Kaifer,An amazing location in a perfectly formed apartment.
42970,319816548,2018-09-07,20577015,Debbie,"Monique’s place is wonderful in so many ways.  It’s within easy walking distance to many restaurants, bars and great shopping streets.  In fact, just step outside and you have a variety of places to eat and drink. The nearby shopping choices ranged from major brand stores to small boutiques on quaint streets. The bus stop is just around the corner so getting here from the train station couldn’t be easier.  There’s also a square to sit with the locals and take in the buzz of the neighborhood!  The flat is very nicely maintained and furnished, including a comfortable bed with extra pillows. A large armoire provides plenty of room to unpack.  The shower is great with the nice touch of Aveda products and plush towels.  We were welcomed with snacks and beer and wine in the fridge.  We also enjoyed the Nespresso machine every morning!  Vicky met us when we arrived and made sure we had all the information we needed and checked in with us to make sure the rain wasn’t getting us down (it wasn’t!).  We ventured out for a bit on the 2 bikes that were available but quickly realized that walking was much easier and safer for us! But we would have tried again if not for the rain! I highly recommend Monique’s place and hope to stay again on our next visit!"
42970,321825733,2018-09-11,186140041,Randy,Monique's place is wonderful and centrally located in the heart of Amsterdam.  The stairs are steep but manageable.  The couple bottles of beer and  water and a bottle of wine in the refrigerator was a nice welcome.
42970,332899577,2018-10-06,145373187,Elisabeth,We absolutely loved staying at this apartment! The location was ideal as a home base while we explored the city. Vicky was very helpful and responsive throughout our stay. We had everything we needed during our stay and are very happy with our choice to stay here.
42970,335519042,2018-10-12,19761956,Peter,"The room was fantastic. Our hosts Vicky and Yannick were real sweethearts. Location was perfect. I definitely recommend this location.

42970,338016643,2018-10-18,6953560,Tho,"It’s great location, just takes around 15- 20mins from Amsterdam centraal to the apartment by walk, and everything you need is just all around. The room is cozy, big and comfortable for 2 or even 3 pp. though the window is facing to the street, it’s very quiet at night time for sleeping. Vicky and her boyfriend are super friendly and helpful and willing to give you extra help anytime. On the second day of my trip, we had 1 more person to join and Vicky offered us an extra air mattress and help us to arrange for our most comfortable stay. We really appreciate and thank you very much Vicky! 
I’ll definitely stay here again when I come back to amsterdam!"
42970,341150663,2018-10-26,3904391,Ann,"I was in Amsterdam for both work and play and it was also my first time in the city. Monique's place was absolutely perfect and far succeeded my expectations. It was really easy to access the place from public transportation (one train straight from Central Station). Her hostess, Vicky, was welcoming and fast to respond. The room is beautiful as the photos and just so spacious and had lovely sunlight in the daytime and at night, you can open the windows to see the charming little street below. Monique left little surprise touches like a travel books to read, umbrellas, few snacks, and refreshments (all included) for us to use. The Nespresso machine really came in handy (along with Nespresso pods!). The bathrobes were super comfy, along with really nice bath towels and toiletries. At night time I had to work on my laptop and the wifi never had any issues. Vicky was also nice enough to show me where to do my laundry within the building (free) during my stay which was so helpful (I had been traveling for a week prior). I would say that location is absolutely perfect for visitors to Amsterdam - everything you need to see or do is well within walking distance. I will certainly look for Monique's place the next time I am back in the city."
42970,342651381,2018-10-29,171193366,Taylor,"Monique's place was great! We received tips for the area  before traveling & were greeted upon (early) arrival by Vicky.  The location is wonderful - in walking distance everywhere yet out of the heavy tourist space. Be aware that the restaurants that line this street are open very late each night on the weekends so there is a bit of noise (which was fine for us). We were offered washer & dryer in case we needed to clean clothes during our stay, had ample towels and Aveda shower products, Nespresso machine & more. Beautiful room & amazing hosts. Will stay again for sure."
42970,344307653,2018-11-03,218097104,Lise,"Very nice place, the location is perfect, the hosts are really nice. We highly recommend."

42970,355180893,2018-12-03,178989894,Lorene,"Great location, great space, great flexibility and reactivity from the hosts.
Super central but not too loud after closing hours of bars/restaurants.
My personal favourite touch was the super comfy bed with the many pillows :)
Only negative point was the faint smell of fries in the bathroom due to the location above a chippy.
All and all, would recommend."

Nous sommes arrivées vers 13h et la chambre n’était pas encore prête mais nous avons pu laisser nos valises :) Nous avons peu pris les transports en communs malgré le froid, c’est dire ! 2 vélos sont disponibles ce qui est aussi sympa pour faire une ou deux petites balades !

Micha was super friendly and it was easy to get to the airbnb. We had horrible weather therefore we couldn't use the bikes but they were always there if we wanted to. And the weather was an excuse to spend more time in the lovely appartement! I would recommend this place to my friends and family anytime. Thanks again!"
42970,424750653,2019-03-17,114154464,Teodora,"THE BEST PLACE to stay in Amsterdam! I just can’t recommend it enough! The location is great, everything is literally on 10-15 mins walk. The flat itself is nicely furnished, full of light, extremely clean, very well equipped and my god the bed is the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on. Micha is an amazing host, very nice and helpful, the communication was very easy, she gave us lots of tips about Amsterdam, she also left some refreshments for us, we really felt well looked after. Thank you Micha for making our stay so pleasant! We will be back!!! Xx"
42970,426470985,2019-03-21,32451881,Suzie,"We loved our stay at Micha's place! The location is PERFECT for Central Amsterdam and public transportation is easy to find. The space was clean and bright, with lots of special touches (like snacks and Prosecco in the refrigerator). Also, the bed - oh my god - without a doubt the most comfortable bed I've experienced in an AirBnb. AND, it's right across the street from a fantastic cheese shop called Dutch Delicacy - go there and sample all the cheese! Thank you Micha, we will be back!"

42970,429846592,2019-03-29,96789035,Nicola,"Room is in a great location, near lots of restaurants, bars, cafes etc. Easily accessed by trams. The bed was large and really comfortable. As others have said the room is on a busy street but noise isn't an issue.
Check in was quick and easy and we were pleased that we could store our cases for the day, when we checked out. We'd definitely stay here again."
42970,432574330,2019-04-04,216591635,Annalisa,"very nice host, nice, she wanted to introduce himself. She made us leave our bags in the apartment even though the check-in was in the afternoon, really very helpful !!

the room is clean, in order, with fridge, kettle and coffee machine (the only flaw the tv did not work). 
if I were to return to the city, I would certainly rebook here"

42970,452543851,2019-05-13,31046091,Kevin,"This was a great place, centrally located in old Amsterdam with an easy walk from the train station.   The place was exactly as described and the pictures show.   Micha met us at the location, gave us some local tips and was there in case we needed anything.   We had a great time.  Kevin and Marion"
42970,457532315,2019-05-24,50566215,Dale,"We had a great stay in Micha’s place. Very spacious and in a good central location. It was a little noisy if the restaurants across the road were particularly busy, but not enough to bother us at night and being within easy walking distance to most Amsterdam sites was well worth it. Micha was very helpful and quick to respond to all our questions. Thank you!!"
42970,464766503,2019-06-06,141141549,Sara,The location was amazing and Micha was super helpful and responsive when I had questions. She let us check in early so we could leave our bags and make the most of our time in Amsterdam. Highly recommend!
42970,468852745,2019-06-13,70019928,Karolina,"Me and my boyfriend had great stay.
Super easy with check in/out.
The room was perfect and so cute.
It had everything!
The location was perfect. Great restaurants close by. And litter my walking distance to everything worth seeing. 
Micha is a great host! 
We recommend this to everyone!"
42970,472648935,2019-06-20,1741781,Jonas,"Clean and beautiful room in a perfect location, which truly makes you feel at home. Can’t recommend enough."
42970,479583771,2019-07-01,53353696,Hakan,Great location and hospitality. Would recommend to all
42970,482989128,2019-07-07,65283287,Jared,"Perfect location, great value, nice whole apartment. The bed was probably the biggest I have stayed on during my European travels and had everything you need with bathroom, shower, bed etc. It was close to most everything you would want to do in Amsterdam, we walked to everything we did. It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the main train station.  Stairway was incredibly steep and narrow. Place was clean and tidy, there was coffee, refrigerator, and silverware available if needed. Host was easy to contact although we kept missing her during our trip so never met in person. Overall would recommend to others."
42970,485548111,2019-07-11,64645463,进,"房东人很好,信息回复的很快,入住､退房都很方便.我和朋友进入房间感觉非常棒,本以为楼下的薯条店会很吵,但并没有任何噪音,防噪音房东做的好,房间整洁干净很舒服,我和我朋友都非常的满意!非常推荐给大家"
42970,495653891,2019-07-26,130725341,Kaylee,"Micha was such a sweet and friendly host who was more than willing to help us with anything we needed. The location really is perfect; everything you could want is within walking distance and the bikes make it even easier to get around. The only downside was that the place is called a bed and breakfast, but it was never mentioned or received. Outside of that, it was an overall great stay!"
42970,498674161,2019-07-30,50615332,Esther,Micha’s place is absolutely amazing. The location cannot be better. The bottle of wine in the fridge was a great touch and I loved having the windows open the whole time. I bought a ticket for the tram system but I didn’t even use it because I was able to get everywhere on the bikes that were provided. I will definitely come back.
42970,502829420,2019-08-05,23587594,Warren,"Room is in an amazing location! Micha is very sweet and responsive. Just be wary that there is noise, as the room is right above a few shops. The windows are quite exposed to the street below too. Also be mindful the stairs to the room are very steep/small. Otherwise we had a great experience!"
42970,512277393,2019-08-18,13620283,Brenn,Loved this apartment. The location and atmosphere really made it. And Micha was very helpful and made everything very convenient. We will definitely stay here again the next time we’re in Amsterdam.
42970,516521283,2019-08-24,27857971,Jon,Here you are in the heart of the city. Lots of food options nearby. Lively night scene.
42970,519712389,2019-08-29,2923933,Abdullah,"Location is at the centre of town close to everything. Quick response, would come again."
42970,522534041,2019-09-02,94358339,Muath,"It’s very nice place to spend your vacation on Amsterdam. Very good location everything is nearby and just a few steps away. Micha and her sister are very helpful and responsive. I gave this place 4 stars because it gets pretty loud and noisy at night because bars are just downstairs, not very quiet keep that in mind. Also, the room is in the first floor however the stairs are very narrow and in a very slope angle where it gets hard to utilize and carrying luggage up or down is an another hustle but I guess Amsterdam in general in very narrow and everything looks tight. Overall, I would stay at this place in the future if I visited Amsterdam again. Great experience. Thanks for everything Micha"
42970,527155328,2019-09-10,110158357,Kylie,"All of the reviews I read were spot on! The most comfortable bed, great location and the hosts were very easy to get in touch with. We are already thinking of our next trip back!"
42970,552732017,2019-10-22,64507609,Yoad,Micha is a very nice woman. Outstanding hospitality. Excellent location - Close to everything! (can be noisy). We enjoyed our stay and will be back again in the future.
42970,555911207,2019-10-28,294855330,Liran,The apartment is very nice and cozy. Location is perfect.  Micha was really nice and quick to respond to everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back.
42970,559952836,2019-11-05,65652383,Fábio,"Space is very good, exactly as the ad, good location that is close to everything. During the night, we did not have problems with noise, despite the crowded street. Just during the morning, for a short time, some noise could be heard due to some construction work on the street. Bed is very comfortable and shower was great. The only two things that could be better were the illumination in the room and support to accommodate luggage."
43109,97016,2010-09-14,211726,Steve,"Aukje was an amazing host.  We were actually a couple hours late because our flights came in late.  Aukje waited for us and was very kind.  She had juice and snacks waiting (which we didn't expect).  I can't believe the location.  It is right downtown on the canal.  We walked everywhere.  The space is very large and clean.  I would go back anytime.  The reasons I really liked my stay was the location, the price, the size and the host.  The only challenge was the stairway.  Like all houses in Amsterdam, the staircase is steep.  If you've been to Amsterdam before, you know what I mean. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me."
43109,2252047,2012-09-10,1292982,Matteo,"The location is just perfect... so near to everything, in the History marker of the city, get out and walk everywhere.
Fun experience on those micro antique stairs, wow!!! Well we tasted Amsterdam almost like being locals, so no plain hotel room.
We had fun and Aukje wasvery easy and kind to deal with.
We raccomende it.

Matteo"
43109,2293181,2012-09-14,3502104,Betty,"It took a while to get in the door, as the key was hidden well, but once we were in, we felt right away at home.  Aukje was quite busy but happy to accommodate us.  I even was able to do a load of laundry while I was there, which was nice.  It felt a lot like staying at a friend's house.  "
43109,2701609,2012-10-24,3638274,Rose,"A fantastic stay!

This is a great room - loads of personality, very spacious, clean and smart.  The room (and handily bathroom) is separate from the main property so you certainly have your own space.  Not that you need it though, Aukje is a magnificent hostess, she made us feel very comfortable and was  at hand with tips (and coffee, thanks!)

The location is also brilliant!

Would 100% recommend."
43109,2814388,2012-11-05,3902992,Julie,"Chambre indépendante dans un appartement charmant. Aukje a été une hôte parfaite :-)

43109,3245570,2013-01-03,4081597,Marco,We had a great stay over NYE. Aukje and Kristian are very friendly people. They helped us with everything we wanted to know. The Location is perfect. This place is more comfortable than a hotelroom. All in all it was perfect for us.
43109,4456100,2013-05-06,5825168,Giuseppe,"Aukje is a fantastic hostess, we were well received and we found ourselves at our ease, the house is full of artistic objects very beautiful and special, our accommodation was divided by the apartment with a balcony, great for your privacy , the bathroom is located within of our abitazion, really perfect.
The location of the house in amsterdam is simply brilliant, just a short walk from dam square, very near to all the other places in the center.
They were also available in many home leave us after check out expected."
43109,8705917,2013-11-12,5817593,Damien,PERFECT LOCATION ! THANKS 
43109,20130453,2014-09-23,12650502,Nick,"We had a lovely stay in this very centrally located studio apartment. The hosts were a  welcoming artistic couple that occupy a  homely space and we were comfortable from the start. The bedroom unit out the back was lovely to stay in with its on-suite and little terrace which was perfect for a glass of wine in the evening.

Full amenities, dishwasher , washing machine/ dryer etc.

The supermarket was very close and the Red Light District was only a few streets away for all the touristy things one would want to see from this area. The recommendations of the markets and local stop ins from our host were also helpful. 

We would stay again, the three fights of stairs are worth the lovely space we stayed in. "
43109,21251628,2014-10-13,22087099,Luca,"Ottimo soggiorno!!!!
Un grosso appartamento in un'ottima posizione. Consiglio vivamente a tutti!"

43109,24733898,2015-01-02,23196815,Iacopo,"La casa è situata in una posizione strategica, nel pieno centro di Amsterdam (dietro a Piazza Dam), nelle immediate vicinanze si possono trovare negozi, ristoranti e coffee shops di tutti i tipi.

L'appartamento è caratteristico e carino, talmente grande che soggornarci in quattro è risultato molto comodo. La proprietara e suo marito sono due persone molto simpatiche e disponibili. Essendo artisti, hanno personalizzato la casa in modo così estroso da renderla affascinante e piacevole da vivere (abbiamo consumato la loro collezione di vinili).

Nonostante il prezzo sia stato un po' elevato rispetto alla media delle offerte (forse perchè siamo stati a capodanno), abbiamo comunque valutato che ne è valsa la differenza visto quando è stato piacevole soggiornarci."
43109,31233197,2015-05-03,19434003,Andrea,"Cool apartment in city center, big and comfortable. You have a lot of amenities very close: supermarket, bike rent, cafe, coffee shop and much more. Just a couple of minutes walking to dam square. Aukje was super kind and gave us a super farm welcome, together with museumcaards, that  gave us free entrance for museums! Thank you again! Ciao!"
43109,33135948,2015-05-25,31950329,Mike,The apartment is located very centrally with a lovely feel. Access to everything nearby and a short walk to the sights. We had a really good time staying here.
43109,38084606,2015-07-12,6513922,Gregory,"Check in and check out was flexible and very easy with no problems.  Great place, great location, and big enough/ private enough for 2 couples. Would def recommend it and would stay there again!"
43109,39235842,2015-07-21,37116160,Steven,"This is a wonderful property.
The listing was very accurate and this is probably the best sort of central location as it was just away from the main roads.
Meeting Aukje was great and she was warm, friendly and accommodating.  We got an instant good vide. After a few minutes we felt very at home here and loved the eclectic mix of literature, music and - most importantly - artwork!
The location is great. The view over the bridge is great. The apartment is great.
We will be back.

43109,39990332,2015-07-27,6503730,Michael,"I had a seamless stay at Aukje's apartment and the location is as close to perfect as you can get in Amsterdam. The apartment is spacious, has a quirky charm and fantastic outdoor space.  "

The location is perfect, near Central Station, in the heart of everything you could possibly want.  The accommodation is spacious, arty and for a day or two you feel like you're a local rather than a visitor!  We accidentally left an outside light on, which understandably disturbed a neighbour; really sorry Aukje and for anyone staying, please remember the neighbours which live around you!  Can't wait to return again!  Thank you so much Aukje! "
43109,54678408,2015-11-22,14943925,James,"Fantastic apartment, amazing location and well organised host. Why would you ever want a clinical 'show house' style apartment when you could have rent an incredible, quirky, arty space like thiswith wonderful architecture! "
43109,56956226,2015-12-20,14931739,Pierrick,"Thank you again for this weekend Aukje. The apartment was just great, convenient location in the center of Amsterdam and views of the canals of Amsterdam.
Thank you again for all the little signs on the Christmas market and other local events.
The little wake up with this view and a small vinyl Ray Charles was just fabulous!

Encore Merci à toi aukje pour ce weekend. L'appartement était juste super, emplacement idéal au centre d'amsterdam et vue sur les canaux d'amsterdam.
Merci encore pour toutes les petites indications sur le marché de noël et autres évenements locaux.
Le petit réveille avec cet vue et un petit vinyle de Ray charles fut juste fabuleux !

Everything was very clean, cozy and the front view is very nice. The Central station is at walking distance, so it is very easy to get to."

43109,65383861,2016-03-13,47848182,Mohanad,"It was very nice and the location was amazing. Right in the heart and near everything, we were a group of 5 people and there was enough space for us all. Our host cannot improve because she was very helpful and kind, aukje's sister handed us the key and explained everything and recommended the attractions and all other information which is relevant in a easy to understand way."
43109,66462913,2016-03-22,50004481,Javier,"Estuvimos cuatro días en el apartamento de Aukje. Su localización es perfecta, está a 15 min. De Central Station. El apartamento está totalmente equipado y es muy acogedor. La única pega, los colchones individuales que estaban en el suelo."

43109,70224263,2016-04-17,7692679,Caroline,Aujke made us very welcome and we appreciated that she was there on our arrival and gave us an extra set of keys. This is a quirky and eclectic flat up steep stairs but worth it for the view over the Singel. A great location and surprisingly peaceful so close to the centre.
43109,71351808,2016-04-24,21946004,Airmat,"Aukje's place is great. Silent but absolutely central - central! Perfect to sleep 6 people on a typical amsterdam-weekend! Thanks, Aukje, we had a fantastic stay!"

43109,77508983,2016-06-01,61509379,Joe,"Myself and the rest of our group of 4 absolutely loved the place. The location is perfect for exploring, as it is right in the centre of the city. Ajuke was a wonderful host gave us plenty space to get on with our own thing, which is exactly what we wanted. Only problem we had was with the front door, however Aukje was quick to react- despite being out of the city- sending her sister over with a lock smith to sort the problem. Aukje and her sister were both wonderful gorgeous hosts with an equally gorgeous property, we are already wanting to return. Thank you both so much again!"
43109,84489203,2016-07-07,6701586,Laural,Great location and beautiful view of canal.

43109,88541929,2016-07-24,37782633,Sophie,Absolutely lovely apartment - great location and Aukje made us feel very welcome and settled in. The apartment is light and very comfortable - everything you need is in there. Being so close to the centre was a massive bonus - Thank you so much Aukje!
43109,91843275,2016-08-06,2182431,Marcelle,"Aukje's Oasis is exactly that- a brilliant apartment in a wonderful area of Amsterdam! Aukje met us upon arrival and her friendly, informative reception was the start of a brilliant week. She kindly helped us up with our luggage. Though there are a few flights of stairs, they are wider than many, and once luggage was up the stairs didn't bother us at all when we came or went daily- great mini work out in fact! 
The photos of Aukje's apartment do not do it justice, it is more beautiful and spacious than we imagined. Arty and hip, without being pretentious, the apartment has extremely spacious living space, a fantastic kitchen and terrace and the most gorgeous bedroom(lovely comfortable bed and terrific views of the surrounding canal houses,) bathroom, and wonderful laundry facilities at the back of the property that allows for a quiet, peaceful sleep after big days of walking, sight seeing and eating- and we were so pleased to be able to wash and dry our clothes.  We immediately felt at home and the apartment facilities meant we had everything we needed to live like locals. The location is terrific, right next to a wide canal bridge with 2 bars/restaurants on it and many more great eateries very close by. It is a very central spot and within short walks to all the hotspots in Amsterdam, Dam Square, Jordaan, the Nine Streets etc. we loved our time at Aukje's place and were really sad to leave. We have stayed at many Airbnbs, and this has been the best by far!! Thank you Aukje for letting us have your home- it made this trip to Amsterdam really special. I would highly recommend this property!! x"

Overall great  "
43109,143461291,2017-04-12,32378389,Chikara,Chase was a great host and it was a great way to complete my week in California before my evening flight out. The hike was fun -- Chase was colourful and his stories provided extra depth to our walk. Thank you!
43109,144165441,2017-04-14,110003061,Diana,"It was my first time in LA and the hike was so worth it and more. Chase was an amazing guide. He showed us all the good spots of where to take pictures and beautiful views of LA. We even got good pictures with the Hollywood Sign. He also told us a little bit about the history about the park we were hiking in. He came prepared with water bottles and snacks which was really generous. Just make sure you're dressed correctly for a hike because it can get pretty hot. Chase puts you through quite a workout but again it was so worth it once you see those views of LA. 

THANKS AGAIN!!!!!"
43109,144472411,2017-04-15,116459962,Erica,This was definitely one of the best hikes I've been on. Loved this history been the park and the views were astonishing!

I highly recommend for 3 main reasons: first, He was so patient and respected everyone's pace without any pressure :) (I had just landed from an 12h flight from Frankfort) which leads me to the second reason, it was super well organized if he hadn't stoped at certain points showing us around telling us stories or just giving us a moment to enjoy the instant I would have never reached the top with that much lack of sleep. And last, Ryan was genuinely so nice and passionate paying attention to everyone! go for it you won't regret it ;) ( and ask for RYan as a guide !!!!!)"
43109,148960956,2017-05-02,124919479,Ethan,"Ryan was a great tour guide through Griffith Park. He was very friendly and easy to talk to throughout the hike and also provided a wealth of information as we went through the trail from the history of Griffith park, LA, and the sign to just basic information about the LA area itself. I would definitely recommend this service/tour to anyone who is new/unfamiliar with LA. "

43109,149774386,2017-05-06,25007774,Noah,Erick led our hike and it was great! He knows a lot about the area and walked at an easy pace. Getting a tour of the observatory made it so much easier to navigate and see everything important.  
43109,149774405,2017-05-06,86785930,Rebecca,"Erick led the hike. He is knowledgeable, friendly and easy to talk to. I liked his stories and the  history lessons were informative. Erick allowed for photo stops and hiked at a nice pace for everyone. "
43109,149774418,2017-05-06,128618163,Robert,Erick was great. He took a photo of us as the sun was setting behind the Hollywood Sign which may be used for our family Christmas card.
43109,149775056,2017-05-06,22765052,Franz Wolfgang,Eric was a good guide and a intetesting speaker!
43109,149781860,2017-05-06,124317065,Jose,"It was amazing and our tour guide Eric was just one knowledgeable man who kinda knew everything about LA and not even LA some places around the city. I would definitely come back to this tour in September and October because I got a good experience. The hike wasn't that bad, he provided us with enough water and snacks. I love this experience and can't wait to go on it again!!!"
43109,150003026,2017-05-06,102282088,Jerrin,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was really great! Eric was our guide and he was very knowledgeable. He was lively and kept the hike interesting by telling us the history of the park and the city. He also gave us a tour of the Griffith observatory with a lot of insider details that you would miss if you go on your own. I definitely recommend this experience!
43109,150423288,2017-05-07,16118498,Alena,"I enjoyed our hike with Daniel! Lots of super useful information about the city, very comfortable pace, nice views. And on top of that, he is very funny and passionate about what he does! I'd highly recommend this hike if you are new to the city "
43109,150425657,2017-05-07,20633748,Jeff,Danny was our guide for this hike and he was great. He's a really nice guy with a good knowledge of Los Angeles and surrounding areas. He kept the tour light and fun throughout and was well prepared for the tour. Our group of 14 people all seemed to enjoy it!
43109,150428922,2017-05-08,114750912,Darryl,My husband and I truly enjoyed this experience. Hike was great and we learned a lot of cool facts about the city. Great view of Hollywood sign during hike and entire city! We considered this one of the best if not top of all excursions on our trip to LA. 
43109,150901066,2017-05-09,9841782,Al,"DW (Dan) was guest guide and was absolutely spectacular! His knowledge of the history of Los Angeles, the land around Hollywood Hills and Griffith J Griffith would put historians to shame!  Totally worth the hike, if you enjoy physical exercise, fresh air, gorgeous views and some history! "
43109,150905281,2017-05-10,5613265,Roland,"DW did a great job touring us through Griffith Park and giving us all the history about the park and Los Angeles in a very entertaining mannor. We enjoyed the spectacular views and learned a lot. DW was very helpful taking pictures, making the group members get to know each other and at the end of the tour he gave us great personalized advice on where to dine. What we also liked was that he wasn't pushing for tips as most tour guides we got to know usually do, but that he himself seemed to have had fun taking us on that tour and presenting his city. Having said that, if there's a way to take 10 USD from my credit card, we would like to show our appreciation."
43109,150907229,2017-05-10,128698156,Wendy,It's a very nice trip.  DW is a caring guide and a great story teller.  Good to know more about Griffith Park from him.
43109,151247678,2017-05-11,24024089,Geoffrey,"The sunset hike with DW was very informative, easy going and we'll organized! DW had a lot of good information about the park, and ensured we ended at the observatory for a great sunset. Would definitely do another tour with these guys!"
43109,151258898,2017-05-12,29971051,Jamai,"The hike was fun. D.W. was very knowledgeable about the Griffith Park. No dull moment the whole time - it was great meeting other people from other countries as well. If you're visiting/new to L.A., highly recommended that you take this hike! "
43109,151454169,2017-05-12,57149938,Meelad,"Eric (I hope I have the right name) was a phenomenal guide. He was attentive to everyone and considerate of everybody. This is a great hike, or what I would call a nature walk, for beginners. If I visit LA in the future, I would definitely consider going on another hike if one is available at a more intermediate or advanced level. Thanks Eric!"
43109,151456608,2017-05-12,71803235,Pedro,Eric was amazing 
43109,151671979,2017-05-13,55473980,Yeras,Love this experience. DW was the best tour guide ever. I would recommend this to locals as well.
43109,151672159,2017-05-13,71937008,Annette,You should do that when you are in LA!
43109,151673808,2017-05-13,121951638,Mahmoud,"Its a great experince to hike up the mountains and see the Hollywood sign. Eric who was guiding our tour gave us a lot of information on History of Cali, LA, and Greffit park and Observatory."
43109,151677854,2017-05-13,124270802,Ana,"DW was great, the organisers on the phone were an unmitigated disaster, there was a mix up with the meeting location because they changed it hours before the start of the hike and I was left waiting for over an hour to meet the hiking group and the people I dealt with over the phone were at best incompetent and at worst an actual hinderance to me getting back on track with the hike. I would follow DW to the ends of the earth but I will never book with bikesandhikesla again, quite frankly I'm surprised I didn't get a refund"
43109,151693119,2017-05-14,36710578,Seukjoon,집전체가 굉장히 깨끗했고 정리가 잘되어있었다. 침대가 푹신해서 편히 잠잘수있었다. 개 두마리도 아주 귀여움. 화장실은 쉐어해야하고 집쥬인은 쫌 무래해보였다.
43109,151694596,2017-05-14,128053476,TaeJoon,"It was a best trip i've ever done. If ma friend ask me about this trip i will highly recommend it to him.
Thank you for giving us unforgetable memories"
43109,152094925,2017-05-14,36362026,Sal,"Chase's colleague Eric ran the tour and Eric was amazing. Not only was he really nice,  he was so knowledgeable. I learned so much about the park and L.A. in general. 

The hike itself is great and the views are inspiring. I would recommend to anyone interested in connecting to nature or local culture."
43109,152102280,2017-05-15,95532364,Candace,"Eric is so great! He is very prepared, well-organized, & fun! The hike is wonderful but don't estimate the walking--it gets pretty intense! They are not lying in that you need to be in moderate shape bc I take Bootcamp twice a day & was still having to compose my breathing as soon as we started. Lol! (Seriously) The hike is well worth the heavy breathing though! You'll be happy you went, take great photos, learn a lot, & have fun! Going to Griffith Observatory is a nice ending to the hike & there are so many hidden, delightful surprises along the way! "
43109,152104011,2017-05-15,110894182,Matina,Eric was great! He was very knowledgeable about LA so we learned a ton about the city. The hike was fairly easy because we do take a lot of breaks. We also stopped by the observatory which was a great experience. Highly recommend this tour! 
43109,152107580,2017-05-15,10182016,Jennie,"Great hike Eric was very entertaining we learnt heaps  about Griffith Park , amazing views loved the observatory . Definitely recommend this "

43109,152339311,2017-05-16,55346244,April And Chris,"Ramble through Griffith park with a pleasant guide. It was nice, but I probably didn't need a guide to do this. The observatory wasn't open, and that wasn't made clear when we signed up. Also we didn't stay until Sunset. I would probably just go hike Griffith park solo without a guide if I were to do this again."
43109,152339459,2017-05-16,9315118,Andhyta,"We got Daniel as our guide, and he's great! He's very resourceful about the socio-economic situation of Los Angeles (which we appreciated more than celebrity-related stories) and has pretty interesting history to share along the way. He also waited for some of us who needed more pauses throughout the hike, and stopped at amazing spots to take pictures. Will definitely recommend this over other activities in Hollywood!"
43109,152346831,2017-05-16,86943397,Tam,Danny was great!!!
43109,152513253,2017-05-16,68661789,Helen,"I really enjoyed the walking tour. Our guide Peter was funny and knowledgable, and told us loads about LA and Griffith Park. Would definitely recommend! "

43109,152515472,2017-05-16,94721531,Melissa,"We had a guided tour with DW and he was absolutely phenomenal. He was super friendly, highly knowledgeable of everything LA, and an incredible public speaker, you could tell he genuinely enjoyed sharing all the information with people. The tour was  really well paced with plenty of breaks and the snack and water provided definitely helped keep us going. All the views were breathtaking and DW knew exactly where to get the best shots. "

43109,152693895,2017-05-17,77406360,Danielle,"On our sunset hike, we had Eric as our guide. He was very informative and friendly and made the experience fun! The hike itself was beautiful, with great views of L.A. and it was not a difficult trail. We even had a chance to visit Griffith Observatory, which is really worth the visit. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the hike and highly recommend it to anyone who wants an experience in the Hollywood hills."
43109,152697037,2017-05-18,81122606,Siu Lun,"It was a great tour! It was a 2.5 hours hiking to the observatory, and we had opportunities to take great photos, including LA city view, Hollywood sign and the observatory. As the tour stated, it requires light-to-moderate fitness, but it rests intermittently so it was very manageable. We were very fortunate having Taylor as our tour guide. He is from LA and he knows everything in LA. He can tell you all the ""hidden germs"" in LA. I found this trip helps me to have a better understanding of the city and the observatory. I would recommend this trip to anyone. You have a chance to know all the local stories and give you a brief intro of LA. "
43109,152698956,2017-05-18,46084789,Marcus,"We did the hike with one of Chase's colleagues Taylor. As a local to LA he knew so much about the city our people that found it. 
He did an excellent job. We were able to ask him anything and we went to many more spots than Griffith. Very thorough and enjoyable."
43109,152885331,2017-05-18,60790548,Shonda,The hike was amazing and Erick was such a great guide. It is a must if you are in LA

I would totally recommend this tour to anyone who visits LA. Eric was awesome and this hike is definitely the most memorable part of my trip so far! 
43109,152886012,2017-05-18,82843055,Svetlana,"The hike was an amazing experience, with great views and great people! Eric, the tour guide, was very knowledgeable about the area, history, and interesting facts. Not to mention, you meet like-minded spontaneous travelers. Definitely would recommend.  "
43109,152887030,2017-05-19,129970023,Carson,"For this tour Eric was our tour guide, not chase. This was honestly one of the best tours I've been on. Eric was passionate, informative, and most importantly funny. DEFINITLY DO THIS TRIP "
43109,152887194,2017-05-19,37364315,Vince,"Awesome hike up the Mountain to Mt Hollywood peak. We visited the Griffith observatory which was great also. One of the best parts was our guide Eric, dude was filled with knowledge about history and made the afternoon/evening such a fun experience. Thanks Eric!!"

43109,153346666,2017-05-20,66730881,Anirudh,"Peter was guiding us through the trek with a lot of interesting stories about the place and breaking strategically so that no one felt too exhausted.
It was also a great group of people with people from everywhere joining in. Was a pretty good thing to do. "
43109,153348292,2017-05-20,126371361,Taylor,Great hike with a great instructor!
43109,153357989,2017-05-21,61503270,Evans,It was pretty fun our guide new all about everything.. he was sooo awesome 
43109,153819072,2017-05-21,120081601,Cortney,"We loved the hike. Due to an event at the Greek Theater, there were some changes and they were great about communicating with us before the hike. Due to the changes our hike ended up being about 4 hours. I think it made it even better. Erik was our guide. He knew so much about the area and even shared personal tips about LA. I would do it again and would recommend this to other people."
43109,153820721,2017-05-21,123507677,Kimberly,We had a wonderful time with Eric!!! He had a great story to share about the Griffith family on our way up to the observatory!!! My son's highlight of the trip to Hollywood!!!
43109,153829235,2017-05-22,128774290,Brianna,"Eric was our guide. He was very nice and knowledgeable. He had a great attitude. The climb can work up a sweat at some inclines, but overall a great hike for some amazing views. The experience was worth it! I recommend others to take advantage of this opportunity!"
43109,153833782,2017-05-22,116364947,Uchechi,I enjoyed myself. Eric was amazing and knowledgeable. I would do this again with them.

It was also a great exercise opportunity! Chase was super nice, welcoming and knowledgeable. We are so happy we went along to this tour and really recommend it to others! Thanks Chase x"
43109,154103533,2017-05-22,131457028,Jayden,Chase is such a amazing person! I had a great experience with him. You should join it :)

Thank you so much!!
"
43109,154300446,2017-05-23,18507333,Peter,"Chase was an excellent, knowledgeable and dynamic guide!  During the hike, he explained a lot of LA history, which was terrific.  And he took the time for the group to experience it at the pace desired (e.g. we went well over the 2 1/2 hour time slot, and he was absolutely fine with that, showing us plenty of highlights at the end of the hike, at the Griffith Observatory).  The hike itself is not difficult, physically, at all.  There are moderate inclines, but the path is well-used, and not strenuous.  We would highly recommend this hike!"
43109,154301491,2017-05-24,43186405,Manuela,"The hike was really great and Chase did really go the extra mile to make it memorable. He is very knowlegeable and I left the trip knowing a lot more about LA, the Griffith Park and the Hollywod sign. In my opinion a must do when in LA. 
"
43109,154502613,2017-05-24,468338,Lisa,"So fun! Chase is entertaining , knowledgeable and full of great stories about the area. We had a great hike, fun family time and it was a beautiful day. What more could you ask for?"

43109,154512019,2017-05-25,106150094,Marnie,"Chase is super outgoing and knowledgeable about Griffith Park and the LA area. We instantly felt comfortable with him and the other hikers. The hike is meant for people of an intermediate fitness level, as the first 30 mins are uphill, but nothing exceptionally challenging. The views are beautiful on their own, but the information and history makes it much more appreciative. I highly recommend hanging out with Chase for the 3-4 hours of hiking! Thanks again!"
43109,154710507,2017-05-25,2381479,Jill,Amazing hike with Chase!! Recommended for anyone who wants to see all the great views and get a very informative (and very funny!) tour!

43109,154720886,2017-05-26,12830110,Alba,We really enjoyed the hike. Fab views on LA and interesting tour of the Observatory. Chase is really energetic and told us new and old LA stories while climbing up Griffith park. It is an experience not to miss if visiting LA! And last but not least he suggested us a place where we had super yummy burritos!
43109,154959091,2017-05-26,118822185,Lubia,Loved the hike. Especially as a 1st timer from New York. Chase is the best and very knowledgeable. He teaches you so much of the landmark! The next day my body felt great after such a spectacular experience. Thank you so much had the best time of my life with this being the highlight of my entire 1st California experience! Love everything about it breathtaking views! Memories to last a lifetime! Highly recommend this hike with the greatest tour guy chase!!!!!! :)

43109,154959503,2017-05-26,3473741,Dan,"Chase was awesome with telling the group the history of LA and also the hike distance was good. 

Anyone could hike on their own but really it was 100% better with Chase and learning more about LA. "
43109,154960547,2017-05-26,84340934,Jay,"Loved the hike, Chase was a great guide and told us a lot about LA's history that I didn't know. Highly recommended."
43109,154969346,2017-05-27,601914,Drew,"Chase was a great guide and very knowledgeable about the history of the park and LA in general. Highly recommend, the views are the best in the city too. "
43109,155254547,2017-05-27,10183525,Venkata Ravi Teja,I signed up for Chase's hike when I was in LA. It was a great experience - Chase is very knowledgeable and personable. He makes everyone in the group feel inclusive. The hike itself is not that hard and you get some really good views of the whole valley. I would totally recommend this one to anyone visiting LA.
43109,155254885,2017-05-27,70886415,Yulia,"We had a great hike with Chase! I cannot imagine a better way to be introduced to the city. Chase is a fantastic story teller, and he enjoys what he is doing. The views were breathtaking! And we will definitely come back both to the park and Observatory!"
43109,155266953,2017-05-28,28370478,Collin,It was a great hike and Chase made it very exciting and interactive.....He was a great guide and gave us a very good description of LA! Would highly recommend booking him for a hike! 
43109,155267281,2017-05-28,61549669,Laila,Chase was awesome. It was an unexpectedly great introduction to the city of LA as it was our first time to visit. The hike was very rewarding too. We got to see a nice view of the city every 10-15 minutes. 
43109,155275037,2017-05-28,59538577,Mary,"What an amazing experience! We learned so much history of the LA basin, Hollywood, and Griffith Park. Chase is a fabulous guide and host. He kept us entertained with stories of Mr and Mrs Griffith, the coyotes and the 100 year floods! Plus he carried water and snacks! Be prepared to hike some hills and be rewarded with spectacular view of Hollywood and beyond. Truly amazing experience and a bargain as well! Thank you Chase!"
43109,155821100,2017-05-28,125190010,Sarah,"This was a fun hike, loved that he brought water for us, he had educational/fun stories for us and was genuinely a nice person to hang out with for a couple hours. "
43109,155823883,2017-05-28,4823568,Erika,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing hiking experience with Chase! It was a great workout and awesome to learn about so many fun facts about L.A. 

My bf was actually hesitant to go at first.. he wondered what would make this different from a regular hike we could do on our own for free, but after our time with Chase, he felt that he learned a lot of great history/fun facts we wouldn't have been able to find on our own and is excited to try more Airbnb experiences. :) 

The only other thing I want to mention is that I did not consider this hike easy lol. Granted, I had my 25 lb baby strapped to my back and I'm not in the best shape of my life, but there were a few parts that included some steep inclines that might be difficult for actual beginners to keep up with. It's definitely manageable, but I would rate this hike closer to intermediate than beginner. 

Great workout and great time! Thanks, Chase!!"
43109,155824554,2017-05-28,50237574,Isabella,The hiking was amazing! Chase is so funny and he knows about everything! I would definitely do that again and I recommend to all my friends!

43109,155830476,2017-05-29,65506795,Francesco,"Chase is a very fun, dynamic, and lively guy who loves hiking and makes you love hiking Griffiths park too, transmitting his excitement. 
The hike is relatively easy, but you gotta be able to bear a 20 minutes stretch that's relatively steep in the beginning – but it shouldn't be any problem. In any case, the views of the city and surrounding areas are really worth the effort!
The history/anecdotes commentary was also great.
Would definitely do it again in a future LA visit!"
43109,155838779,2017-05-29,460163,Lily,Chase is a fantastic guide and the hike was wonderful. It was a little challenging in just a couple of spots but he warned us of this. I learned a lot  about LA history!

43109,159134078,2017-06-10,131532144,Jordan,"Chase led us on a hike that everyone visiting Los Angeles should experience at least once during their stay. It was not incredibly difficult, but it was long. The water and snacks he provided were clutch. Any hike will take more out of you than one might expect so many of us were extremely thankful. The commentary provided throughout, in which much of the scandalous Los Angeles history was shared, was something you might only believe if it were about Hollywood, which it most definitely was. This experience gets an A+ from me."

43109,162214962,2017-06-20,1199866,Paolo,"La camminata con Chase è stata meravigliosa. Los Angeles dall'alto è spettacolare anche grazie alle storie e aneddoti che Chase ci ha minuziosamente raccontanto; è un pozzo di sapere e il suo entusiasmo è contagioso. Alla fine del tour io e il gruppo siamo rimasti all'osservatorio Griffith ad attende il tramonto, ed è una cosa che consiglio di fare a tutti: il sole che se ne va dietro la collina dove è situata la famosa scritta ""Hollywood"" è una cosa da vedere. Piccolo consiglio: anche se andate d'estate, al calar del sole fa parecchio freddo, portatevi una felpa/giacchetto.

Grazie Chase!"
43109,162215945,2017-06-20,64333317,Kai,"He was very friendly and courteous.

43109,162439263,2017-06-21,26766385,Namiko,"Unfortunately I couldn't make it actually. You should leave time to spare. LA is big city and traffic is so bad...

In addition, Chase gave the group an overview tour of the Observatory, which we stayed for hours after the tour.  The hike is not a walk in the park. There are some steep parts and the path is gravel. Anyone with breathing or physical problems should take this into consideration. I would highly recommend this to anyone. "

He was also able to suggest interesting things about the neighborhoods that we saw from the mountain.  I would highly recommend this tour. I suggest taking it early in your trip so you have time to visit some of the areas he suggests.   Also, without being over the top, he kept safety a priority.  Expect a rugged, yet possible walking climb.  A+++  "

43109,169525054,2017-07-12,135743890,Brooke,Chase new so much about the area and the views were amazing! 
43109,169533683,2017-07-13,87578510,Gullrukh,Well worth a trip to the hills with Chase as he's a walking encyclopedia of Hollywood! Note that an Uber might be tricky to get from the Griffith observatory so arrange a pick up that is convenient. 
43109,169533710,2017-07-13,9642061,Samantha,"Fantastic hike, led by an inspirational and energetic Chase who was an exceptional guide. This was an informative and fun way to spend the early evening in the Hollywood hills. "
43109,169721890,2017-07-13,38505364,Penny,"I had a conference in Utrecht and went to Amsterdam afterward for a few days with two old friends. We loved staying at Aukje's place. Perfect location, cool artist's apartment (with amazing books!--we're English professors and writers so we notice such things...) Amazing cafe across the street. As others have stated, it was also somehow very quiet and peaceful. I slept in the bedroom and my friends slept one on the fold out couch and one on a bed on the floor. This worked great for us. We didn't have the chance to meet Aukje but she was attentive and always responded right away. If you want an authentic experience in a great location this is the place for you. "
43109,169826488,2017-07-14,52987592,Emily,Great and informative experience! I wasn't feeling well and Chase was great at accommodating me. The trail was an easy thing to follow and the views were incredible! I would do this again! 
43109,169833239,2017-07-14,36056287,Angela,This hike exceeded our expectations. I took my teenage son and he said it was the best thing we did on our week-long trip to SoCal. Chase was super-engaging and knowledgeable. The views were gorgeous but they were enhanced by the story-telling about the history of the area. Who knew there was so much to learn about the Hollywood sign?  We were lucky to have found this guided hike. 
43109,170538885,2017-07-16,118876076,Angelica,"Chase was an excellent tour guide. Out of all of the experiences you might be looking to do while in LA, this should be on your ""Must-do"" list. 12/10, would recommend to anyone!"
43109,170540637,2017-07-16,94294517,Michele,It was a great experience throughout Hollywood's hills. Chase is an excellent guide and very good LA storyteller!!!! Must to do guys!! 
43109,170549157,2017-07-16,9821393,Sofia,A super walk full of movie trivia. Loved it!
43109,170557058,2017-07-16,113739893,Louise,"Chase was a hoot, his knowledge is exceptional, he kept the group engaged, he didn't loose anyone (which is always handy) and he made the 4 hours fun. We would recommend Chase and this tour. Thanks for a fantastic experience and the great banter. Michaela, Sheridan and Louise Perth Western Australia"
43109,170557079,2017-07-16,101134626,Michaela,Chase gave an amazing tour and gave us a lot of laughs! He knew some really amazing stuff about Hollywood and the film industry as well as the LA area in general. So many amazing views with plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos and met some really cool people! I definitely came away thinking it was 100% better then I thought it'd be!
43109,170856111,2017-07-16,21794406,Tessa,"The Oasis was absolutely brilliant! We loved the house and the location, it couldn't have suited us better. There was plenty of space in the living area for dancing, the wonderful big windows opening onto the canal were stunning. Very comfortable beds, good kitchen...What can we say? We loved it!"
43109,171526719,2017-07-17,115558910,Silvia,"Our guide Peter, was a very good story teller, he kept us engaged at all times. The pace of the hike was good too. I'd recommend this to all fitness levels. Every now and then he will pause and show us something or make a comment so we had time to catch a break. Water and Granola bar were provided. In general it was very informative and pleasant. "
43109,171528064,2017-07-17,19217389,Jody,So much fun! A great way to spend an evening in LA. Fun for the whole family. Hike was not too difficult. Great views. Highly recommend 
43109,171528542,2017-07-18,99554903,Annalena,"It was a great experience ! He provided water and granola bars and shared a lot of his knowledge about LA and it´s history. 
Even without a car the start point is really accessible. 
I would totally recommend his tour!
Thanks for the great time ! :)"
43109,171822424,2017-07-19,20979929,Daniel,"Chase war ein wundervoller Führer durch den Griffth Park. Er hat alle Stadtteile von LA gezeigt, viel aus deren Geschichte erklärt, vor allem den Bezug zu Filmszenen und Orten im Park hergestellt und veranschaulicht. Einfach perfekt! Keine Minute Langweile, viele Erklärungen und zum Schluss noch auf Nachfrage den besten mexikanischen Foodtruck direkt neben unserer Unterkunft genannt."
43109,171825615,2017-07-19,70896129,Bonnie,"We loved this hike. In our group there were people from all over the world ...Columbia, Germany, Norway & Oklahoma, so that in itself was pretty cool (we're from Hawaii). Our guide, Chase was fabulous in his narrative of the city & is extremely knowledgeable. He talked the entire time about history, people, movie productions, legends & more. You'll def find yourself saying ""WOW"" a lot. He advertised the 3 hr Sunset Hike for ""beginners to intermediates"", which was pretty accurate. What was good about this hike is that if you don't feel comfortable going all the way, you have the option to end it where the Griffith Observatory is (we arrived there at around 6p). The hike itself started at 5p (suppose to be Greek Theater but there was an event) so we were notified of the alternate meet-up spot. As you head up there are some rocky areas & steep uneven slopes which made it challenging & somewhat intense. Plus it's pretty hot during summer months when we did the hike. Once you reach the top (for us it was around 7ish) it feels like you won the big prize, breathtaking views & some great photo ops. The Hollywood sign was pretty close to the point we were at, but if you're really adventurous you can find trails that take you even higher/closer to it. The descent down was like having ""dessert"", after having a great meal you look forward to ""it"". The temp became cooler by this time which made it a little more comfortable too. Our hike ended at 8:30p, what an accomplishment for us. Thanks to Chase, this adventure made for some fond memories with some awesome people. "
43109,171826117,2017-07-19,106045804,Jennifer,We had a great time and would definitely do this again.  Chase was an excellent guide with a genuine personality and fun spirit.  The views were spectacular!
43109,172763108,2017-07-21,42583686,Josh," Chase was knowledgeable and it was nice to have a guide on a scenic hike, so that all you had to do was follow, listen and take it all in. Chase was accommodating and our group worked at our own pace."
43109,172763112,2017-07-21,73666945,Isabel,A week paced trek with a very chatty and knowledgeable guide. A lovely way to learn more about LA while getting some exercise in. Well worth it.
43109,172763115,2017-07-21,36281320,Joanne,"Chase is a knowledgable guide and quite funny as well.  Great way to see the city, amazing views and a glimpse or two of the HOLLYWOOD sign.  Overall a great experience, get some exercise while learning some fun history about LA & enjoy great views to boot.  Thanks Chase!!"
43109,172768073,2017-07-22,18687489,Indira,"All was very organized and it was very easy to find him. He works for a Bike & Hike company so he is very familiar with the park. He told us different stories about the park and history about Los Angeles, so it was a fun and learning experience."
